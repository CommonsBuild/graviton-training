# Session 3: BATNA, Negotiations & Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanisms

[Graviton Training](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15UvsnS9oX5czAKIGHZUqJLhrORpPebWsZeCqmUz9BUE/edit#slide=id.gabe59e4cc3_2_9) Google Slides - Session 3

## What is Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)

ADR means any method or mechanism of resolving disputes other than litigation. The theory behind ADR is that settling disputes as painlessly as possible requires good communication, that good communication requires some degree of trust, and that trust can be built where there is legitimacy on the actions taken.  

There are many ADR techniques, like: arbitration, mediation, conciliation, Justice circles, the rent-a-judge program, summary jury trial, and mini-trial, although techniques can be combined to form hybrids suited to a particular dispute or legal jurisdiction.

Handled with sufficient skill, ADR can bring an opponent into the venture as well, as all parties join in a non-adversarial search for a mutually beneficial outcome.

The chances of success for any kind of ADR rely on the premises that parties are committed to the idea of managing the issue peacefully and willing to act in good faith.

**g) [(Español) Sistemas alternativos de resolución de conflictos: negociación, conciliación, mediación, arbitraje, en el ámbito civil y mercantil](https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/4182033.pdf)** (Alternative resolution systems conflicts: negotiation, conciliation,mediation, arbitration, in the field civil and commercial)

> In the civil and commercial sphere, when the law is available, people can resolve their disputes through jurisdiction and alternative dispute resolution systems: negotiation, conciliation, mediation and arbitration.

> One of the essential functions of our rule of law is to guarantee the protection of the rights and legitimate interests of citizens. With that purpose, within public law, is procedural law, which establishes the different dispute resolution mechanisms, which apply to the specific case, the corresponding substantive norm (civil, criminal, mercantile, labor, etc.), to resolve the substantive legal controversy raised by the parties.
> 
> The progressive increase in litigation in recent years has exacerbated the endemic jurisdictional delay, with slow and costly processes for the State and the litigating parties. Procedural reforms in the jurisdictional sphere have provided partial solutions to streamline the jurisdiction, but it is necessary complement them with other alternative systems that guarantee coexistence social, absorbing much of the litigation.

### Self-compositive ADR Mechanisms

**Mediation**: It is a mechanism with which the parties involved look for a third party to help them facilitate communication and build bridges for negotiation, however, this third party does not have decision-making capacity, since it must reach the solution through common agreement between the parties.

**Conciliation**: In this mechanism, the parties involved also go to a third party to help them resolve the conflict, however, they invest it with the ability to propose decisions regarding it. The conciliators have to issue a concept that will directly resolve the matter on which the disagreement is presented, but the proposed solution has to be recognized and accepted by the parts.

### Hetero-compositive ADR - Arbitration

**Arbitration** is a private process where disputing parties agree that one or several individuals can make a decision about the dispute after receiving evidence and hearing arguments. Arbitration is different from mediation because the neutral arbitrator has the authority to make a decision about the dispute. 

**Why hetero-compositive?**
Because in contrast to conciliation & mediation, the composition of the problem is not build from the agreement of the parts involved, but from the decision of the delegated third part.

### Steps for a mediation process

1. **Planning**: Before the mediation process begins, the mediator helps the parties decide the communication mechanisms and **observe** with them who should be present in the process.
2. **Introduction**: With the parties gathered together, the mediator introduces the participants, outlines the mediation process, and lays out ground rules. And presents the goal for the mediation process: to help the parties come to the Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA).
3. **Opening remarks**: Following the mediator’s introduction, each side has the opportunity to present its view of the dispute without interruption. In addition to describing the issues they believe are at stake, they may also take time to express their **feelings**.
4. **Joint discussion**: After each side presents its remarks, the mediator and the disputants ask questions with the goal of arriving at a better understanding of each party’s **needs** and concerns. If parties reach an impasse, mediators diagnose the obstacles and work to get the discussion back on track.
5. **Caucuses**: If emotions run high during a joint session, the mediator might split the two sides into separate rooms for private meetings, or caucuses.
6. **Negotiation**. At this point, it’s time to begin formulating ideas and **requests** that meet each party’s core interests. The mediator can lead with all parties in the same room, or can engage in “shuttle diplomacy,” moving back and forth between the teams, gathering ideas, proposals, and counterproposals.

### Negotiations & BATNA (building a bridge)

**b) [What is a BATNA?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZHMyDW-RDgCDc6tkJjOqBdJ096RRerqq/view?usp=sharing)** (best alternative to a negotiated agreement)

> A negotiator’s BATNA is the course of action he will pursue if the current negotiation results in an impasse. An evaluation of your best alternative to a deal is critical if you are to establish the threshold at which you will reject an offer. 
> 
> Effective negotiators determine their BATNAs before talks begin. When you fail to do so, you’re liable to make a costly mistake—rejecting a deal you should have accepted or accepting one you’d have been wise to reject. In negotiation, it’s important to have high aspirations and to fight hard for a good outcome. But it’s just as critical to establish a walkaway point that is firmly grounded in reality.

**c) [Five ways to keep disputes out of court](https://hbr.org/1990/01/five-ways-to-keep-disputes-out-of-court)**

> The idea behind the adversary system is that the truth will emerge when opposing sides present their cases as aggressively as possible. Even though this ideal is not always realized, the principle is probably sound. The problem with the adversary method in civil cases is not theoretical but practical. First, it is not the most effective way to resolve some kinds of disputes. Second, it can be made more effective for most kinds of disputes by borrowing certain of the nonadversarial features of other forms of dispute resolution. Third, from both the societal and the individual perspective, we may no longer be able to afford it in its undiluted form.


**d) [Rahman, Mediation and mediator skills: a critical appraisal](https://sci-hub.se/https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3231684)**

The realm of mediation has expanded dramatically. Since then, mediation has evolved from an alternative approach to conflict resolution for community activists to a process that has become part of our everyday landscape. Mediation-Skills and Techniques is an essential and comprehensive addition to the professional library of all mediators. The paper adopts an interdisciplinary approach to mediation, integrating knowledge and expertise from law, psychology, and sociology. It provides a time-tested, flexible model for effective mediation in diverse environments and situations. It also provides mediators and other professionals who use mediation such as lawyers, therapists, and personnel managers with comprehensive, step-by-step instruction in effective dispute resolution strategies and a clear overview of mediation and conflict, mediation process, the skills and approaches used by professional mediators.

**e) [Restorative Justice Circles](https://oscr.umich.edu/article/restorative-justice-circles)**

Restorative Justice Circles (“Circles”) provide an opportunity for community members to come together to address harmful behavior in a process that explores harms and needs, obligations, and necessary engagement. 

**Who’s involved?**

* **Responsible Parties** — the individuals whose actions have harmed others and/or the community
* **Impacted Parties** — those who were directly harmed by the respondents’ actions
* **Affected Parties** — others who consider themselves or their community to have been harmed by the actions of the respondents
* **Supporting Parties** — friends or family of either the respondents or the affected parties
* **Facilitators** — training OSCR staff who facilitate the Circle

**f) (video) W. Ury [Getting to Yes in Challenging Times](https://youtu.be/-2lcXp-MiVQ?t=749)**

> i grew up partly in San Francisco and this looks a little bit like the Golden Gate Bridge if you imagine it and getting to yes focuses on techniques for how do you build that bridge. What i've found is that building that bridge is the core of the method of negotiation, but there are two pillars. Those two pillars on either side that are critical if we're going to be successful in getting yes in challenging times

### Keeping a calm mind

![](https://i.imgur.com/emeCju0.png)

There are different rituals to manage your thoughts. The best decisions are always taken when you are in your [optimal arousal zone](https://worthit2bme.com/fightflightimmobolize/therapeutic-window-of-tolerance/). That is, Neither Hyper nor hypo aroused.

[Ho’oponopono](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAuWRuU4uzA) ([is a technique that works for me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brRYPC5y954)), but everyone can find the best way to return to its optimal arousal zone when being in distress. Meditation, exercise, walking, playing an instrument, game or sport, going out, sleeping, etc.

As Jill Bolte-Taylor's noted, the physiological lifespan of an emotion in the body and brain is 90 seconds. So we can control our emotions by the thoughts we trigger in our minds.

* [Dealing anger effectively](https://satsang.arshavidya.org/wp-content/uploads/media/hhpsds/pdf/dealing_anger_effectively.pdf) Satsang with Swami Dayananda Saraswati and Arsha Vidya Gurukulam
  > Anger is nothing but an expression of pain and expectation. Çré Saìkaräcärya confirms this in his writings. We expect certain things to happen and there is an obstruction between what to happen and ourselves. In other words, between the desirer and desired, there is an obstruction blocking the fulfillment of what is desirable. Because of this obstruction, this desire is deflected. The deflected form of desire or expectation is called anger.
* [Anger Management & I Am NOT the Doer – Bhagavad Gītā Meaning (28)](https://www.yesvedanta.com/bg/lesson-28/)
  > Lesson 28 starts out by visually comparing Mind-Intellect-Ego of a samsari (life controlled by desires) – and of a self-actualized person (jīvanmuktaḥ). Then we correct common false notion of limiting Īśvara (God) to space-time. Finally, we discuss what it means to say “I am NOT the doer”. The real doer is Īśvara's laws-orders. This understanding is key to freedom.


### Being a good third party

* Be able to procure safe *spaces for each part to trust in the process* and to open themselves as a way to dive deeper on the issue and collect valuable information.
* Take into account the **feelings** of each part, as ignoring the feelings can prevent a dispute from being resolved. It may be the biggest issue in mediation.
* Feel comfortable with strong emotions. In fact, it has been suggested that an important part of becoming a third part is to **become sensitized to the feelings of others as well as self**.
* Be able to **map and clarify** the situation, helping parties to understand their own interest & risk. and explore all possibilities to conform a satisfactory agreement.
* Help to make informed decisions, pondering expected costs (ex-ante & ex-post) and expected benefits to a negotiated agreement.

### Empathy is Key

Empathy is necessary to be able to apply certain principles of negotiation, as: 
* Separate people from problems 
* Ease communication between conflicting parties
* Focus in interest and not in positions 
* Generate variety of alternative paths to propose solutions
* Use objective or “credibly neutral” criteria to generate legitimacy and impartiality
Empathy brings us together and helps us to take rational and pacific decisions, because individuals who feels underappreciated or ignored are more prone to fall in irrationality just to defend themselves.

### Ethical Standards and requirements for Gravitons

* **Voluntary Process**: All members in the Gravity group participate without coercion from any actor.
* **Self-Determination**: Recognize the ability to promote voluntary agreements. The mediator facilitates the management of disputes but the outcomes belong to the parties.
* **Conflict of interest**: Recognize when they are not capable of facilitating a conversation for any possible reason, personal or professional.
* **Competence**: As we are a community of experts, the mediator, besides being trained in Alternative Dispute Resolution, should be able to prove deep understanding of the specific topics that the dispute may be about.
* **Confidentiality**: Information related to these processes should be handled privately, and strategically shared only with the agreement by the parties. Unwanted information filtered by the mediator is a reason to remove from the Gravity group.
* **Impartiality and neutrality**: The Gravity group members should lead by their example of empathy and acceptance of different points of view, with freedom from favouritism.
* **Professional Responsibility**: Gravity members should assume the task of mediating in the organization with diplomacy and prudence.
* **Rotation**: Three times a year, new training and selection processes will be run to encourage members of the community to become part of the Gravity team. One can only be in this group for three years in a row, to avoid accumulation of power.
