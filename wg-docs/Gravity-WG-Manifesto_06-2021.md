Note! [The Working Group Manifesto is a live document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yrEcPoOW8Q1qDE-YWWF0MhXlcvpiMk0jmdQx25nfZ6k/edit), as the working group evolves (e.g. people join the working group) this document should be updated to reflect these changes. This is important so that there is an updated single source of truth for onboarding new working group members.

(The working group lead is expected to keep the document up to date.)

## Manifesto


## What goals would you like to achieve with this working group?

Foster the practice of nonviolent communication, empathy, understanding and management of conflicts in decentralized communities, to facilitate human coordination and build a culture of trust between peers.

Apply [E. Ostrom’s Principles](https://www.onthecommons.org/magazine/elinor-ostroms-8-principles-managing-commmons) number 4, 5 and 6 (Rules are enforced by effective & accountable monitoring, Sanctions for violations should be graduated, & Conflict resolution should be easily accessible and low-cost), to manage conflict and support soft governance rules inside the TEC

### This working group:

* Improves The [Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S5EoWbsFt3uQ5Wj6yyUJKyApFyjCQ-EloZAr6W55N3U/edit#heading=h.c0rumpnarc97) of the organization and constantly engages the community in this process.
* Defines graduated sanctions, with a complexity scaling approach based on alternative conflict management mechanisms.
* Defines the role of the Conflict Mediator including its responsibilities, commitments and benefits. 
* Designs an onboarding and offboarding process to sustain a constant flow of people accountable for managing conflicts in the organization.
* Generates and collects insights from conflict management processes, in order to constantly adjust the soft governance rules of the TEC.
* Proposes operative solutions to conflicts [a]between members, based on cases from the broader ecosystem and insights about concrete situations.
* Develops a system to document disputes in the TEC and relate conflict managers to the parts involved. (A bot-based communication system for example, but we are open to suggestion)[b]

## How will these derivables be addressed

[Conflict Management for the TEC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J2Vrlb7zXcnCIWf-xmylCY39bL88PJLibz5AdXy-e2M/)

## How will this working group benefit the TEC community according to its [near term mission](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UDnf26QQqqc77mnhn80MLCVzJU6IdvouT-OXPrIVXCg/edit#heading=h.ue2pqr1bbz99)

According to the near term mission ”The cultural and technical build are currently happening to ensure a successful launch of the TEC and are the focus until they are completed and the TEC is allocating funding to support TE Public Goods.”

This group will benefit the community to become antifragile to frictions in human groups.[c]

## What would be considered a success vs. failure?

Success: That people in the community recognize the cultural build and graduated sanctions, acting coherently to the values in the organization. But when disputes arise, there are clear steps to follow in order to receive assistance in the effective search and implementation of solutions.

Failure: Not recognition of this process to address conflicts in the organization. Disputes arise without being channeled to experts, and there is no control or accountables over the situation.

## Please break down the goals into a roadmap with clear milestones[d]
### Roadmap

#### First roadmap. Already checked
1. Design the responsibilities/benefits/requirements of the role of conflict managers.
2. Relate unwanted behavior to graduated sanctions
3. Design the onboarding/training and rotation/offboarding of this group of people related to conflict management
4. Create a system to channel disputes and connect them to experts accountable for approaching parts involved and help manage the issue, solving it with graduated sanctions, or scaling the situation to more complex conflict management mechanisms.

#### Second roadmap: checked with some bullet point pending…
* To design and apply the gravity survey on our and other communities
* To design and test an easy step by step process of gravity
* To make relationships with other communities.
* Creating a framework for conflict (10 common types of conflict)
* Guide for the first interaction <- test, quick invite for a call. (how to handle situations as a graviton- code of conduct)

#### Third roadmap:
* Creating a framework for conflict (common types of conflict)
* Guide for the first interactions <- quick invite for a call, caucuses, mediation and post mediation. (how to handle situations as a graviton)
* improve process design and comms strategies.
* Continue collecting information for the survey, during the training and other events.
* Have the the second graviton training, aiming to have 20+ gravitons from at least 3-4 communities
* look for extra funding options. Joint ventures, Gitcoin grants, DAO collaborations. Selling courses for escalation.
* initialize DAO discussions: How to implement Ostrom and the commons framework to Gravity.
-Design continuous education spaces for gravitons.

### What is the deadline?

#### First Roadmap:
* To have the first generation of gravitons before the hatch
Graviton training, happened from 21 Jan to 11 March

#### Second Roadmap:
* July <- review & also planning next graviton training. :D

#### Third roadmap:
* Review of the second training and bullet points in December
Graviton training, scheduled between 21st September and 23rd November

## Working Style

### What is the pace of the work?

Design an internal conflict management protocol for decentralized social structures.

## WG Roadmap development:

First Call - 2 november 7:00 pm CET

### 1. Design the responsibilities/benefits/requirements of the role of conflict managers.

### 2. Relate unwanted behavior to graduated sanctions

What is the minimum sanction? What are the conflicts associated to sanctions 
[Forum post](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/scale-of-conflicts-graduated-sanction-guideline/234)

### 3. Design the onboarding/training and rotation/offboarding of this group of people related to conflict management

Graviton Training 

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15UvsnS9oX5czAKIGHZUqJLhrORpPebWsZeCqmUz9BUE/edit#slide=id.gabe59e4cc3_2_

### 4. Create a system to channel disputes and connect them to experts accountable for approaching parts involved and help manage the issue - solve it with graduate sanctions, or scaling the situation to more complex conflict management mechanisms

### 5. Identify bright lines for formal legal process (including mediation/appeal[g])

* optional/restorative/compulsory community service
* correct/muting/removal of prior communications on social channels
* suspension/expulsion as member/participation[h][i][j]
* Monetary penalty[k][l] … forced burning, transfer or lock-in of tokens
* Consider purchasing ADR tokens (alternative dispute resolution hours) from LexDAO for the complicated situations

## Notes

**[a]**could this be developed based on other conflicts from the broader ecosystem like we talked since we don't have conflicts yet?
**[b]**meta-eth researchers have a research bot, if gravity team has its own server they could manage privacy and avoid private channels within the main server. This bot asks for consent to collect data, capture messages etc. Perhaps this server could have a sourcecred instance?
**[c]**somehow i might change that to say antifragility, one cannot actually be antifragile...we can aim to be better at these things but there's no level of mastering these workings.
**[d]**Add all this to github!
**[e]**Whenever I approach care work I do these things in order:
1. Check in to see if I have capacity
2. Right away I identify folx whom might be able to support me based on the conflict - I have many mentors for this purpose

My teams generally know we are supporting each other too we do checkins along the way as a group.
**[f]**Before any conflict team works together it is important to learn of eachothers lived experiences / each person shapes their upbringing for the group/ known biases and conditioning. In this we find eachothers blind spots, we can teach eachother things based on our life experiences. This work can't be done well without this vital step.
**[g]**Check with Legal Working group as to bylaws or legal support
**[h]**Shaming is never ok
**[i]**+1 to this comment...I've recently read that the counterpart to praise was a shaming  chant stemming from burningman rituals.
**[j]**Hey, Look!
**[k]**I hope we err on the caution here this looks like shame practices imbedded from social conditioning. We only know to teach by punishing as it is what has been modeled for us, there are other ways.
**[l]**+100
