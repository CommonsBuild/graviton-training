_04-Jan-22 04:04 PM_: @Mettodo 

Hey there Gravitons, wishing you all a sweet start to 2022! 

Gravity has been working over the winter to help Gravity grow into its next iteration. We are submitting for funding this month to expand our services and options for participation as Gravitons! And there are some super sweet paid roles for us to opt into. 

A reminder of our working calls are on Tuesdays at 11am PST/8pm CET and practice calls are Thursdays at 12pm PST/9pm CET. You can find us at these times in the #gravity Working Group Voice Channel.

Now is a great time to get synched up with the work Gravity is doing. We need all of our skill sets and experience to build out a super solid future for Gravity. 

Please react below with your favorite emoji so we know who&#39;s tracking Gravity&#39;s growth üåà

Looking forward to seeing you all soon!

May I ask a question?

Could it help publicise Gravity DAO if all Gravitons bear the Gravity DAO icon as a suffix on their Discord handle?

And then folk may ask, and Gravitons can explain what it&#39;s all about.

LMK if it&#39;s okay!

_11-Jan-22 01:35 AM_: Had a look, thanks.

I guess I can&#39;t vote on or suggest activities, I don&#39;t have that kind of voting power.

Back in the day, I was a project manager, I took a process / functional view, rather than Kanban, with a much better than average success rate.

There must be a discussion space where tasks are discussed, or is that always a group meeting in person? Or maybe folk can submit proposals?

As a process designer, I also knew that best processes start with and stay focused on desired outcomes. So my project plans were effectively task breakdowns of process flow diagrams: start with the required outcome, and design backwards to ensure necessary inputs are completed and provided.

Maybe that happens behind Kanbans here.

So, summarising, I&#39;m definitely interested, and for a start keen to find the discussion space where activities are put forward, designed and voted on.

Maybe that&#39;s a Kanban task to add?

Maybe another is community builder? I&#39;ve done that task twice, now, it&#39;s no small task ...

_11-Jan-22 01:47 AM_: BTW, as a project manager, for every project there&#39;s typically a kick off meeting.

At that meeting, we would talk about the end goal, so folk we were asking to contribute knew what we were aiming at, and could decide whether they were opting in. It&#39;s effectively a sales process.

We need that same focus for Gravitons, so they have the incentive to come and use their skills, not just claim they&#39;ve been on a course.

So, actually, we are seeking to build three levels of Gravitons.

Certificated Gravitons, Apprentice Gravitons, Active Gravitons.

I should mention I was also an EdTech co founder for five years, I look to help other folk grow and progress! I&#39;m also a life long learner, and dedicated career long innovator. So personal and organisational growth for all has always been part of my heart.

Happy to discuss this further, any aspect.

_11-Jan-22 12:27 PM_: Right now there are two main branches, 1 for conflict management services and 1 for trust creation and training activities, I think that if the roles don&#39;t fit or if you think that there should be a bounty created for an activity we are not taking into account, please write that in the feedback part of the google form or lets talk about by PMs or in todays call, i think that bounties should adapt to the skills and necessities we identify collectively. The thing about half a job is really because we want people to have active roles and involvement in other activities, but also one person can apply to several bounties to increase the amount of work and retribution from Gravity. Also bounties are really modest as we are initializing and bootstrapping the project, but i hope that we can increase rates as the project grows üôÇ

(1) Inside the No, 5 steps to decisions that last, by Myrna Lewis. She talks about how to mine the gold in conflict and looks into using all voices in the space. With very practical apporach (using diversity) 
(2) Leadership and new science. Discovering order in a chaotic world, by Margaret Wheatly. My personal guru. She is amazing on how she describes the disruption of what she calls &#39;Newton&#39; organisations and the formation of new, quantum, organic ones, like DAO&#39;s, and what that means for leadership, the importance of relationship. Absolutely brilliant.

We are both squad members!

_26-Jan-22 05:58 AM_: So about content creation, @Juankbell ...

We could follow the example of the rewards community, and host a cross-DAO discussion meeting, writing up conclusions afterwards in Medium.

Topics could be:

1) The need for community in Web 3
2) Creating generative communities
3) Community evidenced disputes eg Satoshi or not Satoshi, fake news, shit coins etc
4) Dispute resolution techniques
5) The work of Elinor Ostrom
6) The perceived value of dispute resolution

This would give the Graviton community an immediate presence, and give us wider community material to work on to help us shape our efforts.

I am in plenty of WhatsApp communities who would likely come to listen.

Love to hear your thoughts!

_03-Feb-22 01:10 AM_: I&#39;m wondering, from the coordination angle, whether a spreadsheet could help, holding frequent questions like this one, and curate a Notion where folk can add answers as they come across them?

Answers could be crowd sourced, and then @Zeptimus can check answers to ensure accuracy and validity, rather than respond to many queries on the same subject. If each question had a like function/emoji, or a window to the original question showing the populatity, we could see which questions needed answers the most.

Would this help?

Discord isn&#39;t great for this, because even with channels, there&#39;s a huge volume of discussion flowing past like the Mississippi!

Notion could also work, adding Discord handles to a question.

I have tried to construct a lightning version FAQ page based on your question, along with other questions here.

Would you please have a look and see if it is a) accessible and navigable, and b) at least in part answers your question? And I need to give you a starting point, you are asking a Learning Curve start position of #Orientation, and you will see a table when you follow the link that I hope will start explaining.

[Graviton FAQ Resources](https://www.notion.so/Graviton-FAQ-Resources-37309732b1304df59335b6c4ff83aef8) 

Your feedback will help tune this resource, which I believe can be useful towards community building, a topic I suspect Gravity and Gravitons care deeply about.

_05-Feb-22 09:23 AM_: Okay, just had a chance to look over this. Thanks again for putting this together @innov8tor3.  

I think this format is useful and I like the different roles for filtering where you are on the learning curve and how that maps to your DAO graphic. 

The Gravity Leaning Curve page feels someone too abstract for someone, like myself, at the &#39;Orientation&quot; stage. I think what I&#39;d be interested in at this point of the curve is information that will help me move from the orientation point to the pathway point. Figuring out what all the pathways into Gravity are. I think that would involve including some high level overviews of the type of work that the gravity working group does and how it conceptually sees itself (diagrams of structure, what it aims to do, how it relates to Ostrom&#39;s principles, and what avenues there are to move into the earning point in the learning curve flow). 

The information currently in the learning curve notion page seems more oriented towards someone in the &quot;Initiate&quot; point of the learning curve flow (how to setup proposals, funding bid and status process, task creation).

Hope that&#39;s helpful feedback

‚ù§Ô∏è 

Maybe also worth embedding the DAO graphic from your tweet into the notion page in order to immediately see how the different learning curve categories relate to each other?

_08-Feb-22 09:50 AM_: hello everyone who had the questions regarding praise and TEC for voting. The praise is rewarded in TEC, but the rewards system still hasn&#39;t made the first distribution after the hatch, they will be working on a retroactive list of praise divided by rounds until we reach the present time. So in brief, for each praise you get, you will receive certain amount of TEC in a period of time.

I hope to see you all today! i will share the doodle for setting our weekly activities, and also will be presenting myself for the coordination manager role. I think its something i have been doing so far and i could do a good work in this new phase of structuring Gravity

_09-Feb-22 05:18 AM_: Hi @LBrian ...

In theory you are already in the right place. Several of us have been through training to be conflict mediators, but I&#39;m not sure what our engagement process is currently. The best person to start with is @Juankbell who is now coordinating effort here.

It might help to spare us any names and details, but give an idea about what you are looking for.

_09-Feb-22 10:40 AM_: Hi @innov8tor3 thanks for response and the invitation to share some details on what is going on in our community. Here is a quick breakdown. 

Our community needs an impartial third party to manage disputes between a few members, myself included. We have tried to direct disputes into a private dispute resolution channel, but our community is so small right now that the people in conflict end up mediating their own dispute resolution process. This is inevitably put us back at square one, where we have been for months. 
The disputes tend to focus around the same one or two individuals. I won&#39;t speak on their behalf or try and diagnose the issue here in a public channel without them here as well. But I think it&#39;s fair to say that both parties aren&#39;t willing to budge, each side sees the other side as the issue. 
Over the last 2 days discussion has really broken down, and it&#39;s beginning to get a bit ugly. We are in the the middle of requesting funding and a handful of channels have been occupied by these conflicts which is not a good look. These disputes are not only dividing the community and halting work but in my opinion, they are now beginning to a effect our ability to fund our initiatives.

_10-Feb-22 01:54 AM_: You are on our collective radar, L Brian!

 (@Juankbell , please step in when you are ready.)

I&#39;m sure you know, L Brian, that dispute resolution can take time, both parties need to be willing to resolve. ü§ù Do we know this is the case? Also, is the dispute bipartite or more multi dimensioned? 2Ô∏è‚É£, 3Ô∏è‚É£, 4Ô∏è‚É£ ...

And what are your timescales please? We need to locate resources and ask for their availability.

Sorry, one other question. The conditions for the dispute may give rise to future disputes, ‚úÖ or ‚ùå?

We would recommend after any üî• that a 
üë©
‚Äçüöí prevention officer would be very useful!

Can you indicate whether that would be useful, if we can address the üî•?

_10-Feb-22 08:35 AM_: Thank you all so much!! @Juankbell has reached out to me and shared first steps.

I&#39;m in the process of attempting to get full buy in from the group of 4-5.
It is multi dimensional, though one person is involved in all of the disputes thus far. 

Timescales meaning how much time do we have to resolve this? If that&#39;s the case then we are hoping to resolve this as quickly as possible because it is effecting our ability to work (we are all currently volunteers). I&#39;m aware that &quot;quick&quot; in this case could be weeks +. 

‚úÖ  The conditions for the dispute are could very likely lead to future disputes. Though I think everyone is trying to resolve this so we can move on. Cooperation hasn&#39;t been 100% yet.

A prevention Officer sounds like helpful resource to have following the dispute. 

**Before you allocate too much time to our dispute I would like to get buy in from the rest of the group**
. If I can&#39;t get everyone on board I don&#39;t want to have wasted anyone&#39;s time here. I truly appreciate the assistance that you have already offered. 

@Naberius I want you to feel free to chime in if I miss anything here. Naberius has been helping build out a dispute resolution process in our DAO.

I&#39;ve put together an outline for a permanent pinned post here in gravity, covering the status of all our tasks, so visitors can see what we are doing at a glance, and enquire further if they need to.

@Juankbell review the document for any changes needed? I hope there are no surpises. Then you guys can decide on format and gloss, which I know I am very poor at.  Nuts and bolts is more my domain, but I love your creatives! A plus point is it is one page A4 for now, but up against the limits!

@Juankbell , if you comment on this document, about what you want to see in the Medium article, maybe we can talk about that, so we can move sooner rather than later?

Just thinking in a brochure format, @Leen , could we see the purpose of the two Practice Sessions on a front page, like we would see on a glossy brochure, detailing what the course does, who would be looking for it and perhaps why?

An A4 one page version of that makes it pretty easy to promote your sessions in Twitter.

_16-Feb-22 10:22 AM_: Hey, @BiancaGadelha !

I can&#39;t attend the coordinators meeting today, could you raise the subject of the permanent pinned post, please? You saw it some days back I think.

I need to know what to do to take it the next step, who needs to agree it, whether @acidlazzer needs to see it yet, all those good things.

Would you look after it for me, and let me know what I need to do next?

Thanks!

 can you give me context about what should I do? üòÖ
 
> Hey everyone!

I&#39;ve put together an outline for a permanent pinned post here in gravity, covering the status of all our tasks, so visitors can see what we are doing at a glance, and enquire further if they need to.

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sJntp5OLoRaChRA77PRsITyAEQK3Nq4u-nGXMancIgk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sJntp5OLoRaChRA77PRsITyAEQK3Nq4u-nGXMancIgk/edit?usp=sharing) 

@Juankbell review the document for any changes needed? I hope there are no surpises. Then you guys can decide on format and gloss, which I know I am very poor at.  Nuts and bolts is more my domain, but I love your creatives! A plus point is it is one page A4 for now, but up against the limits!

@Juankbell , if you comment on this document, about what you want to see in the Medium article, maybe we can talk about that, so we can move sooner rather than later?

Subject to group agreement, that could be used as a first instance of a pinned post.

_22-Feb-22 12:41 PM_: Wanted to share something with Gravity to get a better feel for what you all think. There&#39;s an interesting video series called &quot;Awakening from the Meaning Crisis&quot; by John Vervaeke. The series is his attempt at reconciling cognitive science with spirituality in an effort to create a set of practices to that would foster a culture that could effectively address the multiple existential threats humanity faces. He doesn&#39;t get into the practices as much in this series, it&#39;s more of a scientific and philosophical justification for the project.  Anyway if enough people are. interested, I&#39;d like to start a discussion group. Check it out a let me know what you think!

_01-Mar-22 06:08 PM_: Howdy gravity! I have a couple of thoughts I wanted to drop in the channel for feedback and so I don&#39;t forget them before tomorrow morning.

I dropped into the SanghaDAO server to introduce myself. Ended up having a conversation with someone else who was new there as well. They have quite a bit of experience with solo meditation but also with circling and authentic relating. I&#39;m pretty new to all of these interpersonal practices so not fully aware of all the differences. Are these other interpersonal practices something we&#39;d want to start bringing in? Or maybe we can build those connections while focusing more of our energy toward building really solid infrastructure? Just wanted to see what the sentiment was with everyone participating in Gravity at the moment.

_02-Mar-22 11:15 AM_: The chartered institute of personnel and development did some research in the early 2000s, noting that a third of mental health problems resulting in long-term absenteeism originated from the work place. Whereas two-thirds obviously then originated from outside work. Home can be a stressful place.

_02-Mar-22 11:33 AM_: I agree with @jimscarver , isolation is a known problem, and how can we bring resources to that?

For some reason I can never hear @ALOYSIOUS , and I really want to!

There was a grouping of DAOs in Bankless DAO, @bends , it got to @ 250 DAOs, and then stopped, and I haven&#39;t looked for a while since then ... I didn&#39;t notice many looking at inclusion or mental health at that time. There was a recent get together on Twitter of ReFi DAOs, that could be a way to go ...

_02-Mar-22 12:25 PM_: I would argue that, although I would be cautious about generalizing this too much. Causation is already something very hard to pin down. But from my perspective and from a theoretical standpoint I&#39;d say there are very closely tied together. It is only when I understood my own specific way of functioning in the world that I understood what actually helped me rather than trying hard with solutions that were highly ineffective (because they were taylored to people with different ways of functioning).

I hope this brick of text made sense ^ üôÉ

They have quite a bit of experience with solo meditation but also with circling and authentic relating. I&#39;m pretty new to all of these interpersonal practices so not fully aware of all the differences. Are these other interpersonal practices something we&#39;d want to start bringing in? Or maybe we can build those connections while focusing more of our energy toward building really solid infrastructure? Just wanted to see what the sentiment was with everyone participating in Gravity at the moment.

_09-Mar-22 02:33 AM_: **Who do we choose to be?**

In her latest book Margaret Wheatley (now 75) helps us find out where to put our efforts, what to work on, in a collapsing system. And she does it, as always, in a most extraordinary way. Backed by a ton of nature science and historical insights, and a life time of holding spaces and organising communities, she takes you on a path to discover where we can be most useful. 

The book has 8 chapters. It reads like a train and is very accessible. 
Tomorrow we launch the book, and see how we want to organise ourselves.
We meet in the Graviton Voice Channel at 9:00 pm CET

Hope to see you there!

_09-Mar-22 11:58 AM_: A key thing to bear in mind with any health advice - eg Psychology - is the Do No Harm mantra. Mental health is a very difficult area, it&#39;s very hard to provide good support.

So it may still be that professionals are needed, in certain situations. That moment of handoff is something to be clear on and to know as far as possible when to trigger.

Folks, I have a personal contact in Facebook, Jo Berry, whose father, a serving British MP, was killed by an IRA extremist. She subsequently made peace with him, and has devoted her life work to peace initiatives since then.

I&#39;m thinking a Zoom session with skilled people here testing ideas with her, exploring joint opportunities with her, looking to build collaboration now or in the future.

Branding this with the Gravity DAO label could be good PR for us, and help underpin the Gardens bid.

_15-Mar-22 03:13 PM_: When it comes to practicing to use 
Liberating Structures,
what qualities, traits and characteristics
would make learning easier? 

an open mind

frequency of practice

theoretical frame

purpose

some pressure/spotlight

teaching it myself

a slow pace

safe group to practice

_15-Mar-22 03:25 PM_: How is it that we have an open mind and games and interaction at the same time?

> Folks, I have a personal contact in Facebook, Jo Berry, whose father, a serving British MP, was killed by an IRA extremist. She subsequently made peace with him, and has devoted her life work to peace initiatives since then.

I&#39;m thinking a Zoom session with skilled people here testing ideas with her, exploring joint opportunities with her, looking to build collaboration now or in the future.

Branding this with the Gravity DAO label could be good PR for us, and help underpin the Gardens bid.

What do we think?

(Google &quot;TED talk Jo Berry&quot;, you should find her!)

_16-Mar-22 08:55 AM_: Good question, I think I see what you are aiming for now.

Easier learning is a great goal for anyone, and much needed in any DAO.

It&#39;s fascinating to me to see the difference between folk who can learn for themselves, natural explorers I tend to call them, versus folk who need that bit more guidance and road markings ...

FYI, I was a co-founder on an EdTech startup for five years, and acquired some knowledge in this area during that time.

Education can often be very rigid, difficult to move forward, and in my mind clearly needs Liberating Structures to move forward from the old 19th century model so many still use.

_16-Mar-22 03:06 PM_: I will recommend these evaluations based on the PERMA model

PERMA model [PERMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK6K_N2qe9Y)

> Professor Martin Seligman discusses his foirmula for wellbeing: PERMA

The Workplace PERMA Profile is created by the same authors as the individual PERMA Profiler, but it is designed to assess groups and organizations.

Leaders can use this to assess workers or teams and improve wellbeing in the environment, which will lead to better performance.

Workplace PERMA Profile [https://www.peggykern.org/uploads/5/6/6/7/56678211/workplace_perma_profiler_102014.pdf](https://www.peggykern.org/uploads/5/6/6/7/56678211/workplace_perma_profiler_102014.pdf) 

The PERMA Profiler is an extensive questionnaire from the University of Pennsylvania that assesses each of Seligman‚Äôs (2012) components of wellbeing or flourishing.

This can be an excellent resource to assess clients as they progress through therapy, coaching, or interventions in positive psychology or counseling. [https://www.peggykern.org/uploads/5/6/6/7/56678211/the_perma-profiler_101416.pdf](https://www.peggykern.org/uploads/5/6/6/7/56678211/the_perma-profiler_101416.pdf) 

This one is online, therefore individuals can send us their results and we can create groups of people based on different group characteristics. This PURPOSE+ PERMA Profiler is a quick online assessment that asks relevant questions related to each component of PERMA.

It is a fast and efficient way to assess and compare levels of wellbeing. It will email the results directly to you and compares your PERMA scores with other people in the same demographic. The questions asked in the short survey also provide a great starting point for therapy, coaching, or consulting.

I earned some $Bank a while back, and I can see the exchange rate on Coin Market Cap.

That means one or more exchanges is giving a price.

Also works for xDAI, therefore we should be able to track down an exchange platform for xDAI this way?

Or, what am I missing?

_23-Mar-22 10:14 AM_: Hey there gravitrons . Seeking a Gravitron to help with a conflict. Two people in power positions have decided to use their power to exclude me from groups they are moderators of. But the reasons are that I spoke up on behalf of my needs and against some harmful language against women and autistic people. I suspect that they are retaliating against me and saying that their whole organization agrees with them but I suspect it‚Äôs localized to them. Personal vendetta, abuse of power

I already was invited to a retreat and bought tickets and was involved in the onboarding. 2 weeks before the event they write a letter (together) saying my application has been denied due to ‚Äúconcerns‚Äù

Other people in the retreat don‚Äôt know what the problem is about, never heard about it.

Don‚Äôt want to say more here in your working group chat, however, if anyone is suitable to help with this we are in need of someone with proper training.

_24-Mar-22 03:40 PM_: the reason people struggle with identity is because of the existence of democracy and schools.

 power /caste systems were socially designed to erase our identity. were confused because we think we went to schools to learn we wont admit as a society that schools are really just residential schools still, they just started naming these residential schools after white people and towns.

_28-Mar-22 10:58 PM_: **Aloysious Update //**

I&#39;ve had my head down with my home community transitioning from core member governed project and financed by a research lab to open source and request based $$$ with a limited budget. This has sucked up a lot of time and emotional labor. It&#39;s starting to wrap up. whew

I have also been supported in my own social experiment within ParadigmStates to work on **Authentic Relating**
.  I have begun offering relating sessions where I get to put my acquired and developed skills to the test to bringing people closer to thier authentic selves. 
I work with people on internal to external conflicts,  trauma / shadow work / decolonization and identity reclamation.

My sense of security has not been in tact and I have had to figure out how to keep the lights on after my source of income for the past year stopped being an option. I am hoping to tune in with some more intention, I&#39;m not in the clear financially and that&#39;s the only thing that keeps me from attending all of our meetings.

_30-Mar-22 12:24 PM_: my two cents as a returning graviton // I would like to see a workshop on **consent**
[boundaries] in the training because that&#39;s one of the most important pieces to relating with others and were not offering such material in the community. -Lux Gypsum attended a few classes last season they are a facilitator and one of the best on the content in my experience. I could ask if they are available to teach a session. This is the reason i do not contribute more at the projects, people lack the communication skills to navigate boundaries and consent [this is where conflict comes from], I fail to experience/ have access to autonomy in spaces where boundaries are not advocated for or understood.

> [Consent as an Awareness Practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPM8ZYmZMLo)
I&#39;m interested in Morgan Vanderpool teaching **decolonization**
 the next go around. They&#39;re a graviton and an instructor on the content anywho.
> Anti-oppression and activism health and action w| Morgan Vanderpool, LICSW 

> Recording of workshop from 1/26/22.

We discuss what consent is and how we can cultivate a broader awareness of consent in ourselves, our relationships, and our culture.

_05-Apr-22 07:33 AM_: Hey Leen. What time is the group tonight? 4pm UK time I can make, but I&#39;m out later.

Would this be an interesting problem?

The TEC community are now rating praise, and in some cases folk are praising themselves.

As a Brit, and of my generation, it&#39;s not something I&#39;m comfortable doing, and I definitely won&#39;t be praising myself any time soon. Isn&#39;t value something that can only be measured by others?

As someone in the quant team, I can decide to either accept a community norm,  vote with my feet and leave the quant group, or raise an issue with other group members. None of these options are very appealing.

More detail on this, many folk in communities are in favour of bigging themselves up, often with less than helpful results. One tactic is to avoid such folk, but that&#39;s not very community oriented.

A counter strategy here can be getting to know folk better and allowing them to continue with their largess, but having live awareness of the tendency. Yet I have another principle, about honesty, telling the truth, and also about  all of us needing to learn in situations where it&#39;s clear we need to.

So I have regular decisions to make in these situations. It would be lovely to make clearer decisions, perhaps better able to juggle my competing values, and maybe even bringing in new values to use in these circumstances.

Hope this helps!

 practices  (<em>Authentic Relating, Circling</em>) with groups and individuals.

It&#39;s so good to see that y&#39;all have identified **empathy**
 as a key to success in conflict resolution. Empathy is not something that came easy for me. IME, it takes a lot of time and energy to build that muscle of Showing Up consistently, especially when folks are triggered in a relational space. üíõ 

I really want Gravity to succeed. So I&#39;m offering my time freely to any of you who&#39;d like to practice your **relational awareness &amp; empathy skills**
 with me. üí™  HMU on Calendly and please reach out with questions. [https://calendly.com/ecotexan-stephen/zoom-call](https://calendly.com/ecotexan-stephen/zoom-call)

_16-Apr-22 03:53 AM_: Hey y&#39;all!

I have a community building thought and question set, if okay to ask folks here.

TLDR:

1Ô∏è‚É£ I dropped into Helium, where they have a sizable Telegram community, 31k, and are getting a lot of spamming.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Looking at their price performance, I&#39;m wondering about systems to help community members stay secure, maybe a reputation system for members so other members can tell who they are dealing with.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Maybe this could be based on praise offered, even quite specific praise subsets, we of course could extend the TEC tooling to other DAOs, and spamming is such a nuisance.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Helium have a useful business model, hot spot building; they have a #49 rating on coin market cap, @ $2.5bn, so this clearly works to a degree ...
5Ô∏è‚É£ I wonder if anyone has done any research into the damage spamming brings to community functionality, thinking about any knock on effect, how exchange price is effected. I&#39;m thinking good money will be diverted from good projects into rather more dubious projects
6Ô∏è‚É£ Strikes me Helium could be a good place to try an external project for TEC, I sense there may be an opportunity there, maybe even an offshoot DAO opportunity.
7Ô∏è‚É£ I had this same issue in a FB group where I Admin. It&#39;s smaller, only 12K, but spam levels now are enough for me to want to find a better solution, and Web 2 folk might be okay to try new tech if they could earn &quot;reputation points&quot;.
8Ô∏è‚É£ Hope it&#39;s therefore okay to ask specific people if üÖ∞ Ô∏è they have knowledgeable contacts in Helium,  üÖ± Ô∏è they think this is a good idea.

A final thought, does it fit with any other current TEC plans? Maybe it fits as a community building initiative, which I understand even to be part of the Gravity bag here.

So I&#39;ll tag some folks, sorry if that&#39;s bad etiquette ...

As @MorganicMovement &#127812; suggested, today we will vote to decide if we can have a consent on the starting dates being the 10th of May. Also, its something that i dont like but we might need to be on top of some of the facilitators to place their content in the following days.

I think we could have a deadline that if missed by the facilitator, can be passed to other facilitator who has more availability.

_29-Apr-22 02:29 AM_: This is absolutely awesome!

I need this myself right now, several aspects, and I&#39;m keen to discuss a new idea about this next Wednesday!

In brief, Gravity could do an intro to the LS topic / course, recorded, put on YouTube, and available in longer form to other DAOs maybe on a Crypto Swap basis if they have an established quoted currency eg on Coin Market Cap. Meaning they invest in TEC, using their own currency, which would show demand for TEC / Gravity services and increase perceived value in TEC / Gravity. Lots to discuss about that if folk want to take that direction.

I&#39;d love to get some feedback, @Jeremy&amp;TheGospelOfChange ...

_04-May-22 07:02 AM_: Hi @BiancaGadelha, I finally found some time to go through the questionary you shared during the last Gravity meeting, thanks!. Although I find it a very good starting point for the work you described, I find it somehow weak specially in the last part (work/life balance, too vague) and in measuring personal health. Imho, working in a DAO, which means spending a lot of time in front of a laptop (maybe at home, alone) could be alienating and pose some serious health risk (because of the sedentary lifestyle and continuous exposure to blue light). I also would assess variables such as how often dao workers meet people in &quot;real&quot; life, the amount and quality of sleep, the amount of physical activity, BMI.... Also a test to measure concentration ability would be useful. I really enjoyed the call and I appreciate your work and the activity of the Gravity team. Healthy life style, good diet, physical activity, meditation, self and mutual help, support groups, 1to1 coaching sessions, should all be encouraged inside Daos. I hope I will be able to give a valuable contribute üí™

_04-May-22 11:58 AM_: Hey @BiancaGadelha 

I did a quick view on what LS might look like outside Gravity, based on the slides, and maybe this could be a discussion about next steps for LS.

Do let me know if it&#39;s a reasonable understanding, and maybe it could be base for a Gravity product that other DAOs will see value in.

OR as Juan was discussing, if it could be usefuil inside mediation processes ... 

For me, on bounties, for our Gravity agenda and planning, I&#39;d love to help create a product catalogue for Gravity, which would help folk visiting other DAOs knowing what Gravity can offer, and perhaps even who to get in touch with ... It will probably still need someone to provide some gloss in the digital graphics and marketing, of course!

_04-May-22 12:29 PM_: Hi Gravity! Just recently found TEC and specifically you all. I&#39;m exctied to see practices from my world to be used and empowered in the web3 space. I still new in the space and thus it&#39;s nice to find a point of orientation where the individual and the relationships they hold are put into the forefront. 
I think I&#39;d like to join the training. Who can I get in touch with for this? (And to speak about the details)

_10-May-22 05:57 AM_: Yep, I had a look at that survey, it&#39;s an excellent starting point!I find it a little bit lacking  though in the &quot;individual&quot; section. All the points are somehow focused in the relation between the person and the Dao, but it doesn&#39;t seem to me that it takes notes of the individual in itself. I believe an healthy Dao is made of healthy people (in their individual lives not only  in the aspects work-related) and this should be considered. But still, that survey is a very good model, strong structure. What data have you already collected?

_10-May-22 06:12 AM_: Agreed! And our intention is to focus more on the individual and then provide a mental care, but yeah that&#39;s a good model to start and it was applied on DAOs so it&#39;s very interesting.

We don&#39;t ever lose who we are as a person, or our wonderful contacts. Investments can go down as well as up.

Gravity need to develop products, and be able to see need for those products in other DAOs ...

_13-May-22 04:14 AM_: Suggestions for risk management in Crypto markets, given recent sharp falls:

1Ô∏è‚É£ The people involved are still involved. Their value doesn&#39;t change, there is a bedrock value there, whatever the current price. Key people leaving is something to watch for, though.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Spread risk across different currencies, including fiat
3Ô∏è‚É£ Many tech stocks experience boom, bust, steady growth, with speculators contributing to boom and bust. Can we find the steady builders in the attaching crypto communities? Is there a believable roadmap towards steady growth? And can we then invest time and energy towards steady growth?
4Ô∏è‚É£ All stock reflects underlying value, to some extent. Knowing the underlying value helps us see stock worth hanging on to.
5Ô∏è‚É£ The phrase &quot;Do Your Own Research&quot; was never so important!

I ask my self if I should not be participating in this working group as I am not validated as a psychologist.
I am a trauma therapist, I do that for a living, my college daughter studies thanks to my private practice. I studied formally for 10 years my main two techniques (somatic experiencing and hakomi) I have many more studies and keep training and specializing everyday.
I specialize in developmental trauma, childhood complex trauma and the delicate sensitive cases that colleagues  turn down, many of my clients are colleagues (psychologists and doctorates).
But: I am not a psychologist nor a true psychologist.

_17-May-22 11:21 AM_: I am glad you are here. I think everyone has gifts and tools to bring to this party.

I want to name that western medicine and people taught medicine **institutionally**
 pick up ableism and unrealistic/harmful biases via the curriculum. Its something that has to be unlearned over time. With some contributors like myself and durgadas who have been Advocates for people who are unable to get proper care from the medical systems or worse have been abused by them there&#39;s a heavy tone of decolonization that we carry everywhere we go. We know the sneaky harm that the medical industry causes. We try to speak to the shadows and nuances that people may not be tracking. Often we critique language because we grasp the weight of certain words and all thier context. If you are feeling uncomfortable or unwelcome because of tension when we speak about stuff I would understand that and I also want you to know that we want you here, we value your contributions. I&#39;m comfortable speaking monolithically about how good it is that you are here. Each person has a whole spectrum of insight to offer.  

I think it&#39;s important to name that planning around mental health can cause tension because the topic is so personal and loaded for each person attuned to these tragedies in our society. 

We are doing good work here. What I DONT want to see is mental health being a thing we do in the one month outta the year that people give a bleep. We gotta set up a permanent shop and make mental health a dominant factor in the grander scheme of things. Civilization depends on it. 

I can&#39;t express how excited I am that Bianca was able to push forward this group. I&#39;ve been flailing about naming mental health as why <s>daos</s> people are struggling more over the last year. I left the commons because it wasn&#39;t taking serious my complaints. I returned after a break and started to see mental health being taken more serious.

_17-May-22 01:05 PM_: I love this @ALOYSIOUS. 
My feeling is that we need to be aware that we&#39;ve outsourced NOT ONLY our fiscal lives, which we are trying to reclaim with cryptocurrencies but also SO MUCH OTHER STUFF, including our own mental health via a LOT of Appeals To Authority. 
So, in my view, agency and autonomy MUST exist at the core of DAO efforts about mental health, and I have concerns that this &quot;bringing psychologists to DAOs&quot; could end up with habits like the 4D&#39;s Of Disconnection:
1. Diagnosis (judgment, analysis, criticism, comparison)
2. Denial of Responsibility 
3. Demand 
4. &#39;Deserve&#39; oriented language 
and I&#39;d like to know what we can do to prevent this.

_18-May-22 07:39 AM_: I hope to make some sense with this reply ...

It may not be that you weren&#39;t heard, @ALOYSIOUS , but rather that folk don&#39;t have the tools or approaches to respond with. That can come across as stigmatic, but actually people can be quite helpless without tools to access the needs involved, and tools to make appropriate responses and suggestions. No response can be better than a scared, fearful OMG response!

It is precisely why, in my mind, the work we are doing here is so important. The digital world, Web 3, needs this, because Web 2 signally failed to grasp the problem properly. Working relationships were often toxic, with many instances of bullying and bigotry. That can also happen at home, see my response above. This is a clear opportunity to take steps forward, IMO.

Remember the sector benefits, the value of the people working there.

Learn lessons from what went wrong, act to prevent those issues in future.

_25-May-22 12:11 PM_: Today&#39;s Gravity session summary:

Host: Bianca
Participants: Aloysious, bear100, Zeptimus, ddan, Incandenza, shanzz, durgadas

- Graviton training: Yesterday the presentation of the Third Graviton training was held. Feedbacks. Very good participation. Bianca underlines that only 29 on 36 participants downloaded the POAP. Aloysious will take care of keeping a register of the attendants from next meeting on. It&#39;s also been suggested to create a Linkedin page for Gravity Dao and a certificate that can be shared on Linkedin (besides the POAP)
- Update on the common prize: Gravity is second in the ranking, if anyone owns the token they can vote for us! Durgadas and Juan are preparing a video. 
- Everyone is invited to collaborate to the Gravity Commons Prize Script (Shared by Bianca)
- Reminder: this is mental health&#39;s month. We have the chance to talk about it. Angieberry has created an event to have a conversation about our mental journey. We want a safe and private space to talk about ourselves. We want to make this a monthly event. Appointment on Friday at 8am CST
- Recommended video: Gut Health in #web3, twitter talk on SunGens page (in Portuguese)
- Graviton training in Aragon&#39;s Umbrella initiative: it&#39;s going to be a graviton training specifically tailored on Aragon&#39;s needs. Everyone is welcome to contribute to the training plan on Aragon
- Question: how to share mental health resources? It&#39;s suggested to have a shared document where everyone can collaborate in order to have a wide spectrum knowledge through collaborative work. What about a medium post?
- Under Aloysious&#39; suggestion, Bianca created a shared document named &quot;Burnout Medium Post&quot;, everyone is welcome to contribute
- Durgadas is working on the website. Updates. Planning to have a specific meeting on Friday @ 11am PST, everybody is welcome!!!

Bianca: it&#39;s exciting to see all these things happening around Gravity and we are growing, thanks to the work we are putting on!

 1Ô∏è‚É£ The Commons prize - when does voting finish?
2Ô∏è‚É£ Aragon project - what is the Discord Server (permanent) link please?
3Ô∏è‚É£ Mental Health Resources - how about a dynamic library? A combination of Discord and Notion could be really helpful and easily kept up to date.

_26-May-22 12:25 PM_: Thanks that&#39;s brilliant!

Sorry to ask more questions ...

1Ô∏è‚É£ Does it cost to vote in snapshot? It seems only twelve people voted, and is the vote based on currency holdings based on the wallets shown? Also what currency do I need to be eligible to vote? 
2Ô∏è‚É£ Thanks for the Aragon server link!
3Ô∏è‚É£ Both Notion and Discord are easy to configure, maybe it&#39;s time for a Gravity Discord Server? If only to arrange library resources for access to folk visiting in Discord, meaning arranging materials according to particular channels, with discussion in each channel about how to organise materials. It will probably be good to discuss this some more, there are probably other ways to consider.

_27-May-22 09:24 AM_: I think the most important thing, regardless of the daily routine, is to stay with you for an hour every day. To do things that satisfy you and produce value in your perception. And I think it&#39;s important to be curious and have some healthy boundaries. I think the facts often show us who we areüôè

_27-May-22 11:29 AM_: It can get very confusing sometimes.

_27-May-22 12:12 PM_: Will it always be held at this time? I&#39;m happy to promote the events but for my mental health I cannot do 6am meetings. We could do more than one event monthly though and just have offerings at other times too. 

I really wanna support this effort and the times make it impossible.

_28-May-22 07:45 AM_: Love it! I&#39;m having a look on trademarks and it seems that getting an international one (I guess one valid only in a country is quite useless) is quite pricey compared to the team&#39;s budget, also I&#39;m not an expert on this, maybe we could ask someone in legal. Also @Juankbell we need to ask for a quotation for the nft domain (it&#39;s got a lot of benefits with it, like getting payments in crypto on the domain). If you&#39;re busy I can do this thing

_28-May-22 01:30 PM_: Thanks for doing this

BUDGET: So, even with simple sites, my budget suggestions are to expect $1500 for my time and $500 for software, plugins, etc. A membership site with crypto payment acceptance and user dashboards, etc., like we want will likely be another $500 for software.

Are there any links to explanatory documents that could explain that?

Because then that is another way in to CSTK/TEC, folk don&#39;t need to have disposable income - many of of us don&#39;t - they can earn their way in.

Would be great if these great DAOs found that way to open their doors to more talented folk.

Adding both together could take the effort out of reporting and then learning what is happening, but I&#39;m not aware of such tools yet in OS environments.

I started an exercise on this, but even then a lot of effort was required editing.

_31-May-22 10:20 PM_: Hey lovely souls, I wonder how you encourage parties to a dispute resolution process to open up their hearts, in spite of the fear, and try to reach a win-win scenario.

If it seems to them like it&#39;s too much work or they think they have a strategy to win the win-lose game of appealing to a mediator&#39;s opinion (or internal tribunal, ultimately arbitration, court of law..) 
they might just refuse outright or do the minimum necessary things to seem like they&#39;re trying, but not actually empathize with the other party. And rely on appeal to the next step after 7 days or so (as suggested in a recent proposal by a lawyer [https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-44-dispute-resolution-process/688/](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-44-dispute-resolution-process/688/)

I&#39;m especially interested as we at VitaDAO are trying to define this and think it&#39;s important to the long term health of the organization.

Some say we should use gravity, some that we should just use a traditional corporate &quot;tried and tested&quot; hr process.

> I guess the conclusion is, peacekeeping and cooperation-seeking needs to be an explicit effort rather than peace being an assumed default.

Thing like this are fuel to us! people is becoming more and more aware of the intentional and explicit need for peacekeeping and facilitation for cooperation.

> Hey lovely souls, I wonder how you encourage parties to a dispute resolution process to open up their hearts, in spite of the fear, and try to reach a win-win scenario.

If it seems to them like it&#39;s too much work or they think they have a strategy to win the win-lose game of appealing to a mediator&#39;s opinion (or internal tribunal, ultimately arbitration, court of law..) 
they might just refuse outright or do the minimum necessary things to seem like they&#39;re trying, but not actually empathize with the other party. And rely on appeal to the next step after 7 days or so (as suggested in a recent proposal by a lawyer [https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-44-dispute-resolution-process/688/](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-44-dispute-resolution-process/688/)  )

I&#39;m especially interested as we at VitaDAO are trying to define this and think it&#39;s important to the long term health of the organization.

Some say we should use gravity, some that we should just use a traditional corporate &quot;tried and tested&quot; hr process.

_04-Jun-22 04:56 AM_: Create a safe environment filled with trust. That takes time and consistency. It could be facilitated or not, though at least at the beginning it would be better if someone led it. Work on the internal culture (cooperation, active listening, mutual care, error culture). Don&#39;t look for specific outcomes, the process is the outcome

_04-Jun-22 06:44 AM_: Before you get to court, create safe spaces (meetings), possibly facilitated by professionals, where people can openly share feelings and unburden themselves. This could be a tool to create a different and positive communication&amp;relationship culture, establishing best practices and trying to anticipate most disputes before they arise (through trust, cooperation, openness, nvc...). Then you&#39;ll have the dispute resolution process in place (mandatory) for whatever you couldn&#39;t anticipate/mitigate,  but I think that&#39;s a further step. You&#39;ll see how a change in the environment will impact the whole organization! (Personal opinion)

_12-Jun-22 11:47 PM_: Looks like the A is falling out of the word group, a metaphor that suggests exclusion, not what I look for in groups.

The colour of this one is nice, the colour of soil which nurtures life on our planet.

The symbolism here for me suggests a planet being drawn into an ecosystem, but with the possibility of emerging anew the other side. That&#39;s quite appealing.

_13-Jun-22 10:10 PM_: So‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm having issues at work. 

A former supervisor has been telling people she knows what bus I take and she can kick my ass

And a couple of other women make a point of laughing out loud when they pass me in the hall. 

I did <em>not</em> submit complaints on the second set when they physically confronted me, because I knew I could get out of their department. 

The other is a supervisor who is habitually abusive. 

I think gravity can help.

We continue working on the webpage, rethinking the revenue stream strategies, thinking on financial budgeting for next months and designing new proposals for DAOs to fund our projects. Also, we continue the graviton trainings and  with aragon we will be starting the tailored training for their community on the 23rd of june.

Tomorrow we have a 30 min talk for the metafam community at 7pm CET

and two more things. We want to continue promoting that we receive donations through our gitcoin grant: [https://gitcoin.co/grants/3951/gravity-conflict-management-dao](https://gitcoin.co/grants/3951/gravity-conflict-management-dao)  . and the last topic is that we might need to produce a document to track the complexity of cases, because the per case fee is being low when the scale of one case becomes bigger. So we are thinking on producing a matrix, when we could measure the size and complexity of a case, to receive graduated compensation according to the amount of work given to one case

for example, the current fee could be useful for cases with two to three parties, but when there are more parties we could set a higher fee, or also measuring the amount of private sessions (caucuses) that differenciate a small case from a big one. and a small reward for a higher reward

_18-Jun-22 03:34 AM_: But we have to have positivity, right?

I&#39;m a fan of Steven Covey, and in the 7 Habits he says being positive is a key first step.

I don&#39;t see positivity as excluding complexity. We believe in the power of human ingenuity, right, because we&#39;ve seen it unceasingly over history.

Further, folk are often put off by complexity, and many wouldn&#39;t even start if they understood the complexity they face on the road ahead.

Starting is an important activity, and we need to be inclusive about this. Everyone should be allowed to make a start.

How Embodied Leadership Can Take Your Work to The Next Level
There is a new ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù a new world emerging in the midst of all the chaos we currently experience. We know that our work with individuals and families makes a huge difference in their lives and in the lives of all they touch. We are called now to step into the next level of leadership, step more fully into the light of all that is calling us and give our gifts. As Jean Houston says, ‚ÄúThese are the times, and WE are the people!‚Äù What is needed now more than ever is embodied leadership. This is leadership that comes more from the heart and less from the head. It is relational, compassionate and inclusive.

@Leen .

We can offer options to DAOs once they have started to see the need.

Aragon can be a case study in this respect, and indeed also Giveth, if you can get your project approved.

_20-Jun-22 10:49 AM_: Juan, for one. It isn&#39;t a model, as models, in Cynefin terms, lay between the realm of the Complicated and the Clear and help resolve Good Practice into Best Practice:  However, if we call ourselves a &quot;Conflict Management&quot; DAO then we have to operate in the Management Axis- between the Complex and the Complicated. 
Specifically, we need to be able to understand that ALL conflict is Complex by definition, since it&#39;s just leaping from the Chaotic aspect to the Complex. 
This map starts in Principle 1- which includes all 4 Cynefin aspects, including the Chaotic. It seems obvious we need to do this to include everyone who is dealing with things at any Cynefin level.  The second constraint is that of the Commons- how we deal with the connecting aspects between us. Principle 3 is how we treat each other interpersonally, and how we run into those awarenesses is mapped in between the Commons and each other (LS, TI, etc.) 
This is, therefore, a Map of CONSTRAINTS (the boundary between the Complex and the Complicated) and models and as such is intended to provide context to those who are engaged in Complex Work aka any type of &quot;management&quot; who need both. Management, by definition, is a Complex endeavor and it is made more Complex because human emotions are involved, especially since it&#39;s likely that they are confused and bewildered that they ended up there. 
Roughly speaking, in Cynefin terms, as you move from Complex to Complicated to Clear, you are gradually decontextualizing. Moving in the other direction, you are contextualizing. This is the latter.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622479917065/988455452369092668/climbing-cynefin-11.jpg)

Models are far, far simpler than this. Models are used to Guide Action where as Maps Guide and inform Decisions. The intention behind them is VERY different. 
Further, the Complicated and the Clear tend to think almost exclusively in Divided terms, whereas you cannot manage complexity sufficiently with a Divided mentality. This is a way to make a more Unified approach to management digestible, but it is not intended to be utilitarian, as that is a clockwise impulse. 
It should be clear, however, that each part of this 4 part map and many of the in-between parts contain a pretty large set of VERY effective MODELS that we&#39;re using throughout the TEC and in Gravity cases since our inception. So, to summarize, this is a map OF models, not a model itself. Neither is it a mandate. Mastering a toolbox of effective models makes one a more effective Graviton, and here I am explaining and contextualizing the crucial ones that I am aware of and that we already use.

_20-Jun-22 11:07 AM_: Finally, it&#39;s a map of the relationships between models. There are SO MANY interrelationships between of the principles here that it would be onerous to write them out, but my typical example is Ostrom&#39;s &quot;Low-Cost Conflict Resolution Mechanism&quot;. The lowest cost Conflict Resolution you can have is to set up good relationships between participants such that it creates an overall culture of Trust- one entire half of the map. Similarly, NVC has the same aim. Similarly, Principle 4&#39;s aim is to do the same thing by Transforming Conflict. This map has layers and layers and layers of complexity to it, once you see this.

_20-Jun-22 01:32 PM_: So, I&#39;m not sure that there is anyone who is out there &quot;championing&quot; this observation of the existing group of tools and models and their network effects and the multiplying effectiveness that using them together can create. It takes considerable complexity tolerance to hold space for all of this and understand it.

_21-Jun-22 03:34 PM_: this is the script for the role play we did! Contributors of the same  project in a DAO. 
Error culture. Shared responsibilities. Reconciliation.

Part a
You have been a regular contributor to a project in the DAO and normally your work gets done at the time is supposed to. 
But recently you‚Äôve been carrying a lot of weight on your shoulders from your personal life, you are ending a relationship with a partner, a close familiar passed away and your children of 12 years is having a rough time in school so you are helping them to study over nights. 
You would like to communicate to your colleagues that your regular load of work is being more demanding right now and that you would like to receive support, but everyone else seems also stressed and there are very few spaces for vulnerability, so until now you haven‚Äôt really expressed how you are feeling. 
This week you didn‚Äôt review a document that contributor b sent to share with the public, and people in the project got mad because when it got published the information shared was not precise with the latest decisions taken and it didn‚Äôt really reflected the amount of work that would be needed to complete the tasks of the project.
When you noticed that the information published was imprecise, and the group was looking for responsables, you said that it was part b fault because if they had come to the last meeting, they would have known the things that were not included in the document that was published.

After an initial public discussion in the chat of the team with part b who called you lazy for not reviewing their draft, you try to calm down and have a call with part b to look for solutions. You would also appreciate an apology from part b for calling you lazy without knowing the efforts you are making everyday.

Part b
You have been working with part a for more than 6 months now, you met IRL on a conference and until now your relationship with them has been ok, nothing profound but very work related, and without any tension.
You are in charge of making a publication about the project you two are working on, and you weren‚Äôt able to join last weeks call because it was your partners birthday. 
But you wrote what was talked last time you were in a call with the team. You sent the draft before publishing to part a about a week ago, but you didn‚Äôt receive any feedback, so you thought that the document was ok for publishing on the date it was scheduled. 
After publishing the document, you notice that the team is mad because they say that the information published was not including some key aspects that were discussed in the last call.
In a public chat part a says that is your fault, because you wrote the article, what triggers you and you respond saying that part a is lazy because you sent them the draft for review some days ago and they never responded to it.
After calming down, part a invites you to have a call and you agree with that.

You would like to see this as a shared responsibility rather than an individual mistake and you are willing to make any correction that could be agreed to by the group, either erasing the publication, making modifications or creating a new article explaining everything. It was your intention to help the team and support with your writing skills.

You would also like to receive an apology from part a for telling the rest of the team that it was your fault without recognizing their shared responsibility on the mistake.

_26-Jun-22 12:10 AM_: Hey everyone!

This is a very interesting dispute, with a component here of how can they rebuild?

[https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip41c5-sp3-facilitator-offboarding-mkt-001/12058/2](https://forum.makerdao.com/t/mip41c5-sp3-facilitator-offboarding-mkt-001/12058/2) 

I would think core contributors here like @Leen could have views given their deep theory on what a reconstruction path could look like, and learning what that might be through the dispute resolution and reconciliation process.

@Juankbell if Maker DAO wasn&#39;t on your radar, can it go onto your radar, or should we wait for them to come to us?

I&#39;d like to share that diagram of yours, which is very doable since they are also in the Discourse space, and making Gravity DAO visible via Discourse seems a decent way forward.

And Gravity need to do this moving forward to fit in with the Financial Hack initiative.

But maybe Juan you agree that we need more Active Gravitons to provide support to Gravity DAO in such activities?

I think folk like @bends could be such folk.

What do you think, Juan? FYI @BiancaGadelha

> I haven‚Äôt seen any content that stands out off the top of my head right now, or that made me take time out of my day to watch, which I believe would be the goal of a content team. That said, I‚Äôm open to rebuttal if there are explanations for the lack of performance here and a plan to improve going forward. Otherwise this makes sense to me.
