## Introductions
### Bianca
(06:00)    
**Bianca**:    Today we are gonna talk about Yellow September. We are in Suicide Prevention Awareness month. We are happy to be talking about this with so many people involved in the field. I'm happy to have you all as speakers here. Thank you for accepting the invitation for being here. 

I am very happy to being a host in this talk. We have DDan and Irene as Gravitys contributors Rainy works with Therapy Trauma and DDan works with Gravity on the Nonviolent Communication sessions in the trainings. Marcelo is my professor in college and he has a very long curriculum, and I'm gonna let you guys introduce yourselves and you can give yourself honors for the talk.


### Irene
(08:45)    
**Irene**:    Okay. Hello everybody. I am a therapist and I work with trauma, and the modality that I use is called Somatic Experiencing. I also have a bit of sensory motor approach and hakomi approach and polyvagal. I work this way because I have found, from my own experience, that when you address experience in the body is where things really can be different. 

When I tried talk therapy, nothing changed. In trauma specifically, it's not mental only thing, it's an experience that it's imprinted in the body. That's why I like this modality so much because of their effectiveness in the, in changing the experience. Yes, that's about it. 

(10:07)    
**Bianca**:    That's awesome. Thank you. DDan And do you wanna introduce yourself? Talk about who you are, what do you do, and why you do it the way you do it?  

### David 
(10:23)    
**David**:    Awesome. I've been in the blockchain space for like four since like 2017. That's also coincided with my personal recovery from alcoholism and drug abuse. In that time I've just done tons of study into just changing my awareness and changing my frame of mind, how and live. 

Nonviolent Communication has been a really important part of that for me. It's a really useful framework, not just as a communication style practice that can be really beneficial, but even just understanding the principles behind it, that we take ownership of our feelings and we get clear about our needs and these things are just really healthy for our emotional intelligence, our emotional life, and how we interact with people on a day to day. I'm also very in into psychology, generally speaking. 

Specifically lately I've been into ifs internal family systems, EMDR, neurolinguistic programming (NLP), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and really getting down to what are the mental models that we can take from psychology that are people really need in today's world to know themselves better. Then what are the practices that are really game changing to have the most positive, optimal state of mind so we can do the things that we wanna do.  


### Marcelo
(13:08)    
**Bianca**:    This is awesome. Thank you. Marcelo, do you wanna talk a bit more about you too? Who are you, what do you do and why do you do the way you do it?  

(13:23)    
**Marcelo**:    Thank you. I'm Marcelo Tavaris. I'm a professor at University of Brazil, and I'm a clinical psychologist. I've been working with suicide prevention and crisis intervention for some time now. I feel like I have a passion for working with people who have come to this situation where suffering becomes unbearable and something must happen or must some change, significant change in life is necessary for them to go on. 

It's incredible experience when you can see these people connecting with life again, reconnecting with themselves, with their own experience. It's personally also an experience that enriches my life personally. It's something that keeps me going as well. 

Not just that, the idea of helping people but a person gaining from it. As a professor, I also have personal connection with the process of witnessing people, learning to understand more about how we function in everyday lives as to make life better for us, for ourselves and for others. That's what keeps me going.  

(15:28)    
**Bianca**:    That's awesome. I love listening to you guys speak. I wanna thank you again so much for being here and sharing with us your expertise and everything that you've been doing, taking care of others and taking care of yourself. We see it's so important for not also looking for taking care of others, but taking care of yourself first. I don't remember if I introduced myself, but I'm Bianca. I am representing Gravity today, and we have as a cohost, Angie and Angie, do you wanna introduce yourself? I pass the mic to you.  


### Angie (CoHost) 
(16:20)    
**Angie**:    Hi everybody, I'm Angie. I'm from Mexico and I am a part of the communications team in Token engineering. I also share with Bianca this space in Gravity where we have this monthly event called Mental health, Take care of your Mind, which is a safe space for people to come and express themselves and help them in any way we can. 

I wanted to share that every community member should be prepared to how to respond or even help someone in crisis in the most appropriate way. Because every word that comes out of one's mouth can have a profound effect on someone. 

It's important we are all in a positive and safe environment and make people feel like they can ask for help openly and without feeling like a burden or judged. We have a series of questions to ask our special guests. 

## Guest Questions

### Marcelo: What is Suicidal Ideation?
(17:59)    
**Bianca**:    Yeah, sure. To talk about our topic today, I want to start with Marcelo and he's a psychologist, special specialized in suicide, in trauma and crisis. I wanna ask you, what is suicidal ideation?  

(18:23)    
**Marcelo**:    Okay, the simplest way to understand it is that ideation refers to what goes on in our minds, just like thoughts. If we search on the internet about definition, we will see probably references to the idea of killing oneself. As far as prevention goes, it is really important to have a broader idea about suicidal because it varies in degrees in complexity. 

It is very important to code for some forms of communications that would be more subtle than that ideas, I just wanna be done, or I want to disappear. I can't take it anymore. I don't want to be a burden to anyone. Nobody cares about me. I can't imagine living the rest of my life like this, or my family would be better off without me. 

These are examples of vague ideas, indirect forms of communication that something is not going well for that person, that the idea of emotional or experiential feelings that life is not tolerable or easily tolerated or the idea of difficulty of coping with everyday life. 

These are still not direct communications about intention to kill myself. These are not explicit preparations or plans for committing suicide, but still communicate that something needs attention.  

(20:41)    
**Bianca**:    That was really good. Thanks for answering that.  

### Irene: What is trauma therapy?
(20:49)    
**Angie**:    I'll go ahead and ask the next question, which is too, Irene, we know you work with trauma therapy, so do you think you can explain a bit more about what it is?  

(21:05)    
**Irene**:    Yes, sure. In trauma therapy, what we want is to address the memories of the experience that a person has in their life. Because when we have an experience that it's too much and we don't have enough time to process it, we don't have the proper space to process it or the adequate support. 

We can keep this experience in different forms. It's not always a mental image, we can have sensations, we can have emotions or as if we lived in a situation over and over again. That shapes our view of the world and of ourselves. 

What we want to do with trauma therapy is to address those experiences of memory. In my modernity is done in the somatic experience, in the body, in the senses. We work with all the consequences of this experience, because it diminishes us. It brings a lack of boundaries. 

It brings suffering and it also brings a lot of isolation because many times relationships and attachment styles get impacted by these experiences. We want to address that, and that's how we can prevent suicide. Because it's a very intense topic. I'm trying to do a bit of abstract, but it's not easy because it's really wide and it's really extends. 

In a sense, we want to empower the person so they have their life on their hands. When we have high levels of arousal, it's difficult to have our conscious mind with us or think in mind with us. 

If we let lower this high levels of arousal and discharge the nervous system, we can integrate the functioning of the prefrontal cortex in the brain so we can have all our wisdom with us, all our capacities, reasoning, and then we can deal with things. That's a great extract about it.  

### Irene: How is trauma related to suicide?
(24:29)    
**Angie**:    Well, thank you for sharing your answer. Also we have a follow up question, which is, how is trauma related to suicide and how can we act when we are the ones idealizing the suicide?  

(24:46)    
**Irene**:    Yes. Well, because the experience of desperation and the abandonment and the helplessness and the hopelessness that comes from trauma really lead to this difficult actions and\or intentions. What happens is that the experience that we have in printed in the body because of the trauma, doesn't allow us to notice that there can be different experiences from that one. 

It narrows our disability of a wide possibilities of experiences. Because as human beings, when we are living in balance, we have a wide variety of experiences. When we have trauma, we can only access one or two. We don't see the path where this can be different. The hopelessness and the helplessness is really deep and strong. 

It's really linked because you cannot see it has a solution you cannot see. It can change and you cannot feel it. It's also, there's another thing that suicide is there had been a link between physical discomfort or illness and suicide. With trauma there is a link between trauma and physical illness and discomfort. 

There's another link with the body that you don't feel, Okay, so there's another point to take care of because there's a lot of physical discomfort in many cases. What do we do if you are not a professional? The most important thing that everybody knows and says is that you need to be with someone, you need to have connections. 

What happens is that when we are in these difficult situations, we isolate, we are really lonely, and our capacity for relationships gets tampered and it's not accessible. We think we cannot relate ever because it does, it hasn't happened in until the present moment. The solution is the connection, but also is the most difficult thing to do. 

What we want to do is to notice in ourselves how our own state is because when we approach someone and we are nervous about it, we are preoccupied about this person, they will sense the tension and they will receive it, and it doesn't help. 

We need to look up at how our smile is, if it's from the outside or if it comes deep inside, we look up our micro muscles in the face, how are they? We see our gaze, How is ours? We have to also notice how our own nervous system is. From that place, we can mirror something that is different from the experience of tension or despair. 

We can mirror a possibility and that helps to co-regulate. That is really important. How are you feeling in front of these people and how do you approach? The other thing is that many times connections are not safe. 

We have to be really mindful, how can I make this connection something that it's long lasting, that it's stable, that it's trustworthy, that it's non-judgmental, and so they can feel that comfort with us. That is really important. 

At instead of asking different questions, we can ask, how does it hurt? How are you? Because we really want to know, because it people that are in this spirit, I are almost all of the time feeling that they're not understood.  

Really wanting to know where does it hurt and how can I be of help? And maybe there are no words that they can come up with because in those heightened states, many times you cannot communicate properly. We keep saying it, we keep being our presence is really important. 

That's also important, the importance of seeking for professional help. It's like sometimes they can access it and sometimes I don't. Not sometimes, many times it's not accessible. That's really important. Maybe the family are not doing it, maybe someone else is not doing it, maybe the person's not able to do it. 

Do they need professional help? That's another thing that we could support with because with helplessness we cannot do much for ourselves. It's like there is a lot of a big list of things that you can do to feel better, but in that state you're gonna do them. We can support by doing some things for them.  

Try to bring connection and of being there because sometimes the crisis comes and we are there and then we're not, and their life is the same. That part of long lasting things is really important. We can think about how is it good for me, a good balance so I can be there for the person and not feel bad myself? 

How much is good enough for me that serves in my presence to the other. The other thing, it's, I mentioned earlier about the face, how is your smile, your muscles and your gaze. This part is really important because today we chat. Today we are on servers. 

Today we are without camera and not in person because we relate to people that are really a long distance from us. That part is really important for the human being. It's the presence and the looking in the eyes and it. That is really another piece. Well, there's a lot of things that we could talk about, but mainly we can do that. Our presence is really important.

### David: How to help someone with suicidal thoughts?

(33:30)    
**Angie**:    Thank you for sharing your amazing and helpful answer. We have another question for Dan, which is, how do you see ways to help someone with suicidal thoughts, especially using Nonviolent Communication?  

(34:02)    
**David**:    Yeah, thank you. Thank you Irene. The question was how to help. When I began my recovery that came after an actual attempted suicide. In the beginning, just like what you said I got with family and people who cared about me into like a safe space where I could be. 

Once I like decided I had to change things and I got off the booze, but there's all kinds of related issues. When you're totally miserable, all I could do is just keep thinking over and over again about my problems, about my mistakes and things that, all the things that were wrong with life.  

The problem is, you can't change anything by focusing on your problems. Yes, you have to assess your life without looking away at the difficult parts, but you have to move in a direction that you want to go, and you have to choose what are you gonna do moving forward and have a focus. 

For me, that was study and research and learning and developing my skills. That ties into Nonviolent Communication in the sense that it was inspired by the work of Victor Frankel in Man's Search for Meaning and through, he was a doctor who survived through the Nazi concentration camps. 

That was one of the things that got, which I highly recommend that book to anyone, but especially people who are struggling because you can see the difficulties, the extreme suffering that people went through and how they were able to get through it. 

The way these people were survived is they all had something to live for, some reason to stay alive. They had something to share. They had someone to see, they had whatever the case may be.  

More specifically into Nonviolent Communication. There's just so much of in emotional intelligence and developing a relationship with our emotions and our experiences, and Irene was saying, where we experience them in our body. How does that feel? Where does it go? What is it doing? Is it spinning in some direction? Is it in the front of your body? 

Just gaining a more deeper intimacy because a lot of times, that with the trauma and all that we are really, it's a reaction trying to protect ourselves from the direct pain of confronting. What we actually need to do is experience and is to feel, and especially when you localize it within your body, it takes some of the focus away from your cognitive processes spinning and more into that sensation and a subtle shift happens in your consciousness. 

Taking ownership of our feelings and taking responsibility for them. One of the biggest points in Nonviolent Communication is that we try to identify clearly what is a specific action we are activated by. Mostly we are accustomed to judging, whether it's ourselves, whether it's our others. 

Nonviolent Communication shifts the focus from judging what people are into how we feel related to specific actions. I feel angry when you do this specific thing just now, a real concrete example. 

Then you tie that feeling in with the need, which all one of the premises of NVC is that we all share universal needs. We're all trying to meet the same needs. It takes away from the judgment and understands that we're all trying to meet needs here. 

It's also another shift that with practice and thinking in that way, you learn to treat yourself a little more kindly and more rationally because that language of judgment uses our emotions as fuel, as like weapon of attack, you know? 

Instead we can get more practical and specific on what behaviors we don't like and why, and then figure out different strategies for meeting our needs where everybody's needs can get met So that's framed a bit in the conflict management sense, but it applies you have to be able to work this with yourself before you can really use it as a conflict solution. 

Discovering what you have to do having that vision, having that future that you wanna live for that's what, that's how you don't get mired in all of the ills of the world by directing yourself in a way that hopefully can improve upon the world, is what most of us are wanting to do. Yeah, that and learning to be, to judge actions and not people, and that's so crucial for ourselves and for all of our relationships. That's all.  

(43:42)    
**Bianca**:    That's beautiful. David, thank you so much for sharing that. There is a lot on Nonviolent Communication to learn and to put in practice every time that you shared about it. I keep like rethinking and yeah, it's like an everyday process that we go through. 

### Marcelo: Different types of suicidal ideation
**Bianca**:    I wanna go back to Marcelo and he talked before about this suicidal ideation and that it's when somebody wants to put an end to a feeling or something that they are experiencing, that's the idea of it. I want to know if there are types of different types of suicide ideation.  

(44:49)    
**Marcelo**:    Yes, we can think of it in terms of different types and it is very important when we're listening to someone going through some experience that is painful to listen for those different kinds of communication. 

We're talking about communication because if a suicidal ideation is completely private, if the person never mentions it to anyone, it doesn't become visible, its hard for us to act in a preventive way. 

We understand that this communication can be either verbal or behavioral, and in being verbal or behavioral, it can be explicit or covert or veiled disguised in a way. To look at the, some of examples, if we think about the examples I gave before would be verbal, but also covert, disguised ways of saying. 

Another example would be like someone says, if anything happens to me, would you take care of my children? That would be a verbal communication, but it, even though it doesn't talk about suicide directly, it talks about, in my absence, would you take care of my children? What is bringing to that person? The idea, the thought of they can be absent. That idea could be the idea of suicide. 

For another example, now overt and verbal, these would be affirmations of an intention and explicit intention or a plan to kill myself, something, I won't be here by Christmas, for example. I won't be here in what way? Or I will kill myself, or you can't prevent me from killing myself. 

These would be affirmations that there is an intention, explicit intention to kill oneself. Now, overt behavioral would be actions or plans to, in preparation for attempting suicide. These, again, even though they are over behavioral, they can be misperceived. We cannot see the in sometimes we cannot see the intention if the person buys something that is a means to suicide or acquires a firearm or any other means of attempting suicide. 

An example of covert behavioral would be given away prized possessions, something that is very important to that person or that and their personal history or their related to their identities, and they're given away to important people in their lives, these private price possessions that can indicate that they're preparing for a suicide.  

We look at ideation from the perspective of communication. These forms of communication can be either verbal or behavioral and they may be disguised. That's basically how we look at it in hope to be able to bring that, these ideas, these topics, to explicitly engage the person in a process of understanding what's going on. 

Just to tie this answer to the comments that previous comments either about traumatic experiences that have been in some form registered in the body or about things that ideas that we need to reconnect with experiences or feelings to understand our needs. 

What the speakers before me mentioned about either working with trauma or with importance, effective or emotional experiences is very important. In a way, the suicidal communication is a communication that there is some form of suffering, some form of experience that needs to be understood, expressed, and dealt with. Thank you.  

### Marcelo: How alarmed should we be after someone confessed to contemplating suicide?

(50:41)    
**Bianca**:    Thank you. That's very interesting to get that knowledge about the communication because basically everything is communication. Like if we act a certain way, we are also communicating. I have another question that it includes that aspect because we hear that it's a myth that people who talks about suicide is not going to conclude the act. How is this in real life?  

(51:27)    
**Marcelo**:    Well, in terms of myths, we have to look at in two different directions to either we can downplay or minimize the importance of suicidal behaviors or suicidal ideations, or we can exaggerate in both ways. Could do some damage or make things worse for the person. 

Listening attentively is the most important recommendation to what the person means by their own experience. The idea about being non-judgmental is important because if I treat what the person is experiencing as right or wrong or attach any moral value, that from my experience, can create a condition that will not facilitate communication. 

The myth goes both ways. Oh, that's not important, that person doesn't really mean that, or it isn't that bad, or that person has, oh, she has everything in life, or he has everything going for him, that's downplaying the risk.  

The other extreme is going in the other direction as like this is the end of it all. There's no help anymore. We can't really do much about it. That person is beyond our help. I would suggest if we look statistically, even among depressed people, less than 10% that have depression, severe depression attempt suicide, and even lesser number of those die by suicide. 

If you don't look just about depression, if you look at people who have attempted suicide, of all those people who have attempted suicide, less than 10% die by suicide. In terms, the fact that the person may have had a suicidal ideation or even suicidal behaviors does not allow us to conclude that person will commit suicide. 

The key factor here is, okay, what's going on in that person's life? That life has to be questioned. Why now? What's the meaning of this? What needs to be changed? And what needs to be changed is a question that aligns very well with non violent communication. 

The key thing about Nonviolent Communication is understanding what emotions arise in situations and what needs they relate to. **If you understand the need and after understanding the need can express that need in ways that it can be met. 

That's when you see these people move away from the suicide risk and they integrate in their lives, new alternatives that meet their needs and therefore brings, gives them a better condition to regulate emotions and have satisfactory relationships and all the rest of it. 

It's a process that once the person understands that engaging with this idea of understanding one's experience, one's needs, and the meaning of effects and their lives, then a change is real significant change is possible. 

The myth, either one, it's not really that bad minimizing it or it's the end of everything or that there's no help anymore. Either way, the myth will make it difficult. 

> If I focus on what is happening, what's the need, why now, what's the meaning of it? What can we do to meet these needs? Then we can make a significant change or help this person facilitate meaningful change in life.  

(56:57)    
**Angie**:    You for sharing That was a great answer.  

### Irene: How can therapy help someone contemplating suicide?

(57:07)    
**Angie**:    We have another question for Irene, which is, how can trauma therapy help someone who thinks they are about taking their own life?  

(57:22)    
**Irene**:    Okay, If we think about trauma as a heightened state that it's taken us to an edge and it's so unbearable that we cannot hold it and we don't know what to do with it and it's surpasses our capacities. 

The first thing that we can do is start to lower that heightened state. The awareness of the body is not inaccessible. So we are not in that vortex of unbearable feelings and sensations and thoughts. 

If we don't lower that and discharge the nervous system, we cannot access the other capacities and capabilities of the person because we have to, we have to acknowledge that everybody is really wise and has everything they need for their life and for the problems they're facing. 

When we are in a heightened state, we cannot access that wisdom, that capacity. If we assume and we know that everyone has this wisdom and this capacity and knows what to do and how to do it, and has everything we, what we want to do is to make it accessible because at that present moment it's invisible or inaccessible. 

We want to, the heightened state many times becomes to life because of past experiences and because of a sense of threat. It can be present and it can be passed. Yeah, as I mentioned before, we want to bring the sense of safety and that is really the basis of everything else. 

There's also many other things that we want to do because if this state doesn't allow us to see possibilities, to see solutions, to be, to see that things can be different in the sense of how we experience them. 

Some things do not change because we look about many suicides, they are from minorities and marginalized people and we cannot change the system and the world, but we do can change our experience about it and some of the things we can change.  

This is really important, but because we have to be real and well in all of this, we want to address belonging, feeling understood, and self respect. That is a common element that we find in people with this ideations. 

We also find really common that people have had a recent huge loss in their life. We want to address a way to manage that loss or that growth. It doesn't have to be the debt of someone, it can be different types of loss. 

There are many problems with the economic situation. Today we are living in a special moment where all of these situations are lived by children and are by younger people. We're living in a world that climate change and economic system and war and insecurity and we're living in a really different world right now and really difficult and we have a huge task in our hands.  

That's why I like about thinking about DAOs and about different types of economics because we have to create those options. Those are the things that we can do something about, but are difficult to change, and there are things that we can change, but when we are in those states, we cannot do much self care. 

We need to lower that heightened state so we can do the things that we need to feel better. We also in trauma therapy a lot understanding in the sense of psychoeducation so people can understand why they feel this way, why they cannot see options, why they feel it's unbearable and it is unbearable, it's true. 

Give this validation is really important and we want to bring them options of experience. For someone that lives in chronic pain or lives in deep suffering, I can sometimes live with not pain for a second at least I can sometimes feel with the no suffering. 

We start small because big changes bring the self reacts. It's like I don't trust this big change and reacts. We go slowly by slowly changing from pain to no pain, to comfort to something nice because when we are living those situations, we cannot access the good feelings, the good thoughts and the good experiences and resources. 

It's like they are inaccessible. We go slowly until we can access a micro moment of feeling good and then we can go from there into the really good experiences that we know that life can have and our beings can experience. It's a really slow and step by step. 

Trauma is also not only too much state. It's also at too fast and no space and no support state. We want to bring a lot of time for it so we can recover like airplanes recover because they are aerodynamic. 

The is so static and the self can recover, it's resilient, but it needs support, it needs space, it needs time. We can start teaching regulation of emotions and the body states, but first by correlation because no one does regulation just by itself. It starts with correlation and then we can teach regulation of their states.  

What else about social skills? We work on social skills. We address attachment, trauma and talking about somatic sensations we work in the reaching out because if you can reach out in your body, then you then can go into reaching out to somebody. 

We work with that. We also work a lot boundaries. It's a big issue with this topic because if we can say no, if we can have respect in our own personal space or if we can fully develop our identity and differentiation from the other. 

That is a great place to be so we can act. We can do many things and I could say a lot more, but that's a good, that's a good part. Thank you.  

**Bianca**:    Thank you Irene. I love that. I love that what you said the self is able to be covered and it needs help and it needs attention in all the aspects. 

### David: How can DAOs be more present for real life problems like suicide prevention?
(1:07:00)    

**Bianca**:    I want to ask David, and it's more like in the space about Web Three, how can DAOs be more present in the real life problems like this one that we are talking about today? How do you see that?  

**David**:    I would like to start out by pointing our listeners to the [Gravity DAO tweet for this space](https://twitter.com/DavidDanforth12/status/1575576846552342528). I dropped some links in the comments of that post. A couple helpful worksheets that can help us identify positive and negative distortions, automatic negative thinking and challenging negative thoughts. Those are a few really helpful frameworks for getting practice in recognizing like the workings of our minds. 

A lot of stuff Irene was talking about, in the DAO space in general and I see this as something that Gravity, that as a role that we can help to fill is just in number one, having a collection of resources of these type of these type things that help us to identify where we're our thoughts can trick us up. 

Maybe for most DAOs you might just have like one day a year or one weekend a year or an event every year or something so that even though like most of your flow isn't focused on like personal wellness, mental health, emotional development, at least one weekend a year, one week a year, it could be.  

Having that consciousness and having the resources in place so that when people are struggling that they can find what they need. There's a bunch of tools that we can use and those can be like a bit more concentrated. 

Irene was talking about the body language, the communication skills, all this is really important. Actually that reminds me ego strength. Something that we don't really understand in the public consciousness. Consciousness we talk a lot about like breaking down the ego and egolessness. 

Instead, to be a healthy productive person in the world, you need to have a strong ego. What we think of as ego mania is actually evidence of a weakened ego. We need to have this strong sense of ourselves in the world.  

That comes from good, healthy habits of sleep, eating healthy, community, your work skills all the things that make you feel grounded in on this planet that you have the security to live your life and to move forward. 

That can help bring down some of those activated states where we get all charged up, but when we have that good ego strength, when we know, okay, hey I'm upset but this disagreement or this challenging situation, this isn't the end of my world because I like I have this whole network of strength built around me in. 

So that's briefly backtrack to some of those fundamental frameworks. As far as practices meditation, I tell you what I started December of last year meditating every day and for the first few months I was doing 1-3 hours a day, and now I'm at around half hour a day.  

It's made a huge difference in my ability to just manage the day to day and my overall presence with the world. It's somewhat of a long-term practice, but it only took a couple months before I really started noticing the differences and then within six and now like nine months, it's like for sure. Very powerful. 

There's a lot of guided meditations that people could find on YouTube. I just really highly encourage everyone to get in a practice and you can find them even like 5-10 minutes and work your way up. Find what works for your schedule and be creative. 

Maybe that's how you can go to bed is just listen to a guided meditation, or maybe you get up before anyone else to steal 20 minutes for yourself, whatever works for you. 

Internal family systems is another cool thing to learn, it supposes we all are made up of different parts that want different things. The trick is learning not to think of ourselves as a homogenous unit but recognize that we have different parts. 

That's part of why there's conflicts cuz different parts of this want different things and just getting more aware in that sense can help you like before conflict emerges, you can just be aware that there's different parts of you that want different things.

#### Richard Bandler's Getting the Life you Want

We could even do like a really short exercise, a little short imagination work for reframing some emotion to a more positive or reframing some, just an example. This is something that I picked up from [Richard Bandler's Getting the Life You Want](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Get-the-Life-You-Want/Richard-Bandler/9780757307768). 

He has all these really cool exercises where you identify a situation and identify the emotion and where it is going within your body and then you identify the opposite situation and find out where that feeling. 

Then, if you want to feel better about a certain thing, then you can move that into the place in your body where you recognize that you're feeling good or motivated. Yeah, that's a good one. Lets do motivation, cuz that's a neutral subject. 

#### NLP Exercise

First we want to think of something that we are super motivated to do. No one could stop us. When it's time to do this thing, you are just full bore. I just want you to imagine, if you have pictures in your head, what does that look like and then where are the pictures? Maybe the pictures aren't in your head, maybe the pictures in your shoulder or what, wherever it happens to be. 

Then what are the senses? Do you hear anything? Do you smell anything? Do you, what do you feel? Where in your body is it in the front of your body back? Is it isolated? Is it just in one particular area? Is it vibrating tingling? Is it moving counterclockwise around your center or is it moving forward front to back, top to bottom thing or back top to bottom? Identify all that. 

Once you have all that in mind and you're anchored in those sensations and those feelings, then you can think about something that you've been procrastinating and you've been putting it off, but you really wanna do it, and you're going to do it, but you've just have been dragging your feet a bit.  

Think about that and think about where that is in your body and how what you're hearing, what you're smelling. Does it taste like something, whatever sensations, what direction is this feeling moving, where is that located? 

Okay, so now you can take that image of the thing that you've been putting off and you can move that into the space where you were super motivated and you can change the direction of the motion to the direction of that you wanna feel. 

If you change it to those other modalities, you should find that you are now associating those positive feelings with the subject you were previously dragging feet on.

You can even do things as simple as once you've identified, you don't even have to contrast them, but just isolate a single anxiety on their own. Once you find the way of feeling is moving, you can in your imagination spin it faster in the direction if you want to feel more that way and spin it in the opposite direction to feel less of that way.  

That's just a little taste for neurolinguistic programming, Rricher Bandler, Get the life you want. Really highly recommend it. It's like just super cool ways that we can use our mind to create our experience and not just be subjected to whatever we wake up with and whatever life throws at us. 

It can be really effective immediately, which is awesome. A lot of this work is long term, but there are some tools such as NLP and also self-hypnosis and different programs that you can find that will suit your particular needs and your particular situation. 

Please do your research and make sure what you're getting into and some of the programs will have, sounds that alternate and if you're just be aware if you're sensitive to different sounds. Just make sure you're working with something that feels good for you and doesn't activating you further. 

Talk to me again in another six months or a year and I'll have a lot more complete answer. That's what I can offer right now as far as all that goes.

**Bianca**:    That awesome. David, thank you so much for sharing that. We talked about this a bit before and I was personally very curious about it and the practice is very interesting. We can feel it and how it works and the material that is shared, it's very valuable. 

Thanks for sharing it with us and all your knowledge and everything and everybody else, thanks for being here. 

## Conclusion
I wanna do a last round if you wanna share something quick that you felt that you missed or that you wanna add to the contribution. I would go back to Marcelo if you wanna share something else.  

(1:23:06)    
**Marcelo**:    Okay, well just the idea that if you are in contact with someone that you think may be of risk or having some suicidal ideation, be a good friend, listening, supporting, being there, not judging, encouraging help seeking behavior is very important, especially seeking professional help in these cases. Sometimes we need to take the person's hand and help them get access to professional help. 

In general, being compassionate and being present as a good friend. If you are in a professional role than you probably have more information about how to deal, how to help, but that's the way that we can make a difference in this world. That's it. Thank you. It was a pleasure to listen to Irene and David and I thank you very much for the invitation to be here.  

(1:24:30)    
**Bianca**:    Thank you so much Marcella for sharing with us. It's a pleasure to listen to you. I will pass it to Irene. Do you wanna share something quick that you wanna add?  

(1:24:43)    
**Irene**:    Yeah, thank you Bianca. I agree with Marcelo. It's been a pleasure. I'm honored that you invited me and I loved hearing David and Marcelo on this topic, just a difficult topic. 

I love that we did the visualization because it's a difficult topic so I bet it helped a lot us all. I want to say something that we haven't mentioned is that it's important to do not do exposure treatment. Do not judge, do not do opinions or comparisons. 

We want to empower, not take away the power and we want to talk about it, we want to normalize it. It's like this prejudices that it's surrounded. Okay, you are living this and this is hard, but we want to talk about it. 

Something really important, I always explore the biological, the physiological part because maybe something is happening. That is really important. It's the first place to go and always seek a professional place. 

There's a thing that I want to bring consciousness to that every part of the system, every professional enterprise, organization, institutions, we need to make conscious efforts to understand and to be responsive. 

The personal impact that every action and interaction and law and norms and everything has in the people that we interact with because of their unique experience and context. Because everything we do has an impact. 

We need to have the context and have a accountability of the effects that institutions and organizations and people will happen, all human beings and their lives. Thank you.
