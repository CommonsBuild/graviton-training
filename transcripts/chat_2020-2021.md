_23-Nov-20 09:16 PM_:	Applying systems thinking, the other approach is to measure "conflict" (however defined) and create a damping feedback loop so designated community stewards get tokens reduced for increasing conflict levels and praise for rapidly resolving. **It takes a village to raise a child**

_26-Nov-20 09:56 AM_:	@Dulce This is the agenda for today:
1. Do you think conflict management should be done with or without a group of people designated to hold accountable for it (Ostrom says Monitors should be accountable to the appropiators or are the appropiators themselves) - So its a) the capacity to manage a conflict is shared between all members or b)designated people are responsible for it
2. what would be boundary of this internal management layer that is proposed? can we have support and legitimaty in both the TEC and de broader TE space, or will it be seen as a "state intervention"
3. How can we apply TE (modeling,simulation, analysis) to make ur conflict management smarter -The initial propose is really a human layer to facilitate communication between stakeholders and provide ADR mechanisms

Punished By Rewards is, I think a way to shine a light on some of the systems we've put in place. Even the Praise System itself might feel less like a good idea after you read it.
                    
When I heard the name of the conflict resolution group was called Gravity, I thought it was great since it pulls all of us together.

_26-Nov-20 01:34 PM_:	I'm showing all this as a result of our own desire to meet the need I hear in the group to have actual data to work with. Alfie Kohn is the one really clear voice for using actual data and studies to show the problems with all punishment/reward systems. We often repeat these punishment/reward systems even though the people participating in them do not really want them, they have become so used to how they work they are in our subconscious assumptions. I see those echoes even in this group, even though I have been made to feel very welcome generally by such an inclusive group.

And if there is going to be a conflict, it seems to me that what is going to happen is inside one of these punishment/reward systems buried in the collective psychological shadow of the group.

_26-Nov-20 02:50 PM_:	So it makes sense to try to shine a light on these things both inside of each individual but also into the structures we create and the assumptions we carry into each structure.

_26-Nov-20 08:30 PM_:	Also, this is itself a tool to deal with things at a human level but knowing which place people are coming from, it's useful to contextualize people's needs in rough groupings. For this I use Spiral Dynamics.

just came here after contemplating how I can help - so one thing I can definitely offer is a recap of important inspiration - that is also important for TEC of course - from Ecosystem Valueflows course:

The conflict I see is this: I see typical mistakes that are being made also being made in TEC - but I have full trust that we can fix whatever will break because we move too fast - but I cannot ignore what I see (and I fail to put it in words that are diplomatic) --&#176; so happy to offer this for the TEC leads when the group is facilitated by @f8 - and we can keep the sessions to 3x 60(+30) mins

_03-Dec-20 02:56 PM_:	I can't make the Thursday calls in the next couple of weeks, but the area of managing communication is my expertise. When speaking about communication, it's useful to think about the actual terminology. Our words create the world. Using the terminology "conflict resolution" is going to create conflicts to resolve. Yes, conflicts are inevitable and often good, and at the same time it might be framed differently. Similarly, the terminology "NonViolent Communication" implies that communication could be violent. Other disciplines do not have that attitude and represent personal responsibility both on the output and input sides (what you hear and how you hear it). I would be happy to help but I would like you to guide me in what ways my contribution could be most useful.

<h4>durgadas#9280  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/249005209710362624/fd52223eb3a60649ccd2e83b04f65f61.png" width="25" height="25" /></h4>

_03-Dec-20 03:02 PM_:	Compassionate Communication is an alternate name for this approach of Rosenberg's as well. I have the same observations about Ostrom's work, which is also very colonized in it's thinking when you read the book.

<h4>GraceRachmany#9780  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/519634011908341760/c599ceae790b944e0dca6259b445526e.png" width="25" height="25" /></h4>

_03-Dec-20 03:06 PM_:	Not sure what "colonized" means in this context. One of the issues that I'm seeing in conversation now is this idea of "fragility" where people can't be with certain communications. Being offended, hurt, etc., by communication can cause a situation where everyone is walking on eggshells and there are certain things that can't be said. Training people to be anti-fragile and just face the "offense" when it happens is an important part of the training. One of the disadvantages of some kinds of training is that it only seems to work well if everyone in the conversation is "obeying the rules" or trained in that form of communication. It is possible to train people in a sort of communication that allows absolutely full communication with anyone, at any time, in any situation.

<h4>durgadas#9280  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/249005209710362624/fd52223eb3a60649ccd2e83b04f65f61.png" width="25" height="25" /></h4>

_03-Dec-20 03:15 PM_:	Well, I do think it's not invaluable to keep in mind the history of the cultural context in which we're speaking. This is, like Neil Postman speaks about a kind of "thermostatic response" to the imbalance in a cultural dialectic. So, if one is to speak with a proper context one can understand the needs and feelings underlying someone's experience, rather than invalidating it. This is indeed a compassionate approach. So colonization did happen and the echoes of this reverberate in certain populations today and the cultural frameworks of violence, exclusion and assumption still exist in those cultures today and often without our ability to consent or opt-out of them. Thus, it is in this way I see the titling of Marshall Rosenberg's work. I was agreeing with you in the sense that you mentioned the terminology of "Non-Violent" implies violence and apart from the reasons I listed above, I am saying Ostrom's book contains terms like "Third World" which is fundamentally a term used in the sense of colonization. Indeed, the monetary system is set up much the same way as we heard from the Spirit Foundation in the call just now.

I think it's in this group's potential to avoid such scenarios and work toward subverting such assumptions to the degree to which we can.

_03-Dec-20 03:29 PM_:	Hello Grace! so happy to see you here, i remember a statement you were developing on the crypto law lab about how most economic profit is not valuable for humankind, look forward to be able to keep having dialogues with you. Also i understand that "conflict management" and "graduated sanctions" can be troublesome terms, but to be antifragile as humans and then also as organizations is to be able to manage our conflicts and behave according to social agreements, that in our case are descentralized, so initially i like those terms.

_03-Dec-20 03:39 PM_:	[https://libcom.org/files/zz_aime_cesaire_robin_d.g._kelley_discourse_on_colbook4me.org_.pdf](https://libcom.org/files/zz_aime_cesaire_robin_d.g._kelley_discourse_on_colbook4me.org_.pdf) Even though i don't like the terms "third world" and i have studied discourses on colonization, its impossible to not recognize the geopolitical differences in the world. So it's not necessarily bad to refer to general concepts when you are developing a statement over them -using them as a variable for further conceptualization-.

_03-Dec-20 03:42 PM_:	One could see, for example, Mona Eltahawy's The Seven Necessary Sins For Women and Girls as a similar issue around feminism-as-response-to-oppression

So, from where I sit, this kind of understanding is key to understanding how to arrive at a balance, but especially when we are building the tools underneath economies. The unwise application of a principle or an assumption on the part of the framers of this tech can easily have implications that might exist only in the subconscious of the people framing it. And it is this I am eager to shine a light on so we can avoid those problems down the line when pressures are high not only for time.

<h4>GraceRachmany#9780  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/519634011908341760/c599ceae790b944e0dca6259b445526e.png" width="25" height="25" /></h4>

_03-Dec-20 03:54 PM_:	These are fair perspectives,. Personally, I try to stay out of framing everything in an oppressor/oppressed framework. I think it's a bit overused today and also doesn't respect the fact that the power dynamic is a normal and natural cycle of personal and societal development. We are at a new cycle of development which will include and transcend,. My sense is that some of the oppressed/oppressor dialogue is fixated with setting things right or repairing some damage, rather than seeing this as part of a developmental progression that had to be passed through in order to reach the next level.

Repairing the past is always doomed to failure. As humans, we are designed to move in a linear forward progression in the temporal dimension.

_03-Dec-20 04:28 PM_:	Well, if it was something left long ago in the past then I wouldn't be mentioning it. It's alive in our cultural "legacy codebase" up to this minute. Being aware of those influences is really all I'm talking about here. If none of that existed, we wouldn't have any need for conflict resolution at all.

_05-Dec-20 10:30 PM_:	it is partly social signalling (shunning/exile) and partly netiquette (as to what is acceptable). Because of lack of physical proximity, IMHO the token is a proxy representation of reputation and social standing. In extremis there may be legal sanctions (like confiscation in case of fraud).

_05-Dec-20 10:36 PM_:	It is possible to train people in a sort of communication that allows absolutely full communication with anyone, at any time, in any situation.
There are a lot of structured communications from formal (Robert rules of order) to ethical (Chatham House rules). It is up to TEC to come up with a minimum positivism subset to encourage vigorous debate on the various channels without degenerating into name-calling or vulnerable to external trolling. Best implementation of evidenced-based policy (as per Geek Manifesto)

_06-Dec-20 08:40 AM_:	Hey  We are researching various alternative justice approaches and models, to take what we consider the best of them for the design of our our own (for decentralized communities).  The initial discussion is showing us two scopes on monitoring capabilities. 1) where a group of people is held accountable for providing ADR to the community, and 2), where the community itself proposes procedures to moderate themselves (like Chatham House rules for selected topics). I see benefits in both of them and think we can have mixed approaches.

_10-Dec-20 09:41 AM_:	Hello Everyone! Today's Gravity Wg agenda is the following:

Icebreaker question: If you were some type of edible, what would you be? üòÇ

1. Keep promoting the use of the Typeform [https://the-commons-stack.typeform.com/to/rCVsK5RK](https://the-commons-stack.typeform.com/to/rCVsK5RK) 
2. Can we have consent that having a group of members inside the community that is accountable of facilitating ADR for the community is still mutual-monitoring? and that there is no external influence on them. Why? 

a) The monitors are the members of the community
b) Everyone can fill the typeform and inform issues, even with conflict managers.

[TEC Gravity - Conflict management](https://the-commons-stack.typeform.com/to/rCVsK5RK)

Easy access for conflict management mechanisms

3. Review the epic "Conflict Mgmt Role Design"

_07-Jan-21 12:12 PM_:	4 types of listening by Otto Scharmer
**Dowloading**: This type of listening is limited to reconfirming what we already know. Nothing new penetrates our bubble.
**Factual listening**: We let the data talk to us and notice disconfirming information. Doing this requires opening the mind ‚Äî that is, the capacity to suspend our habits of judgment.
**Empathic listening:** We see the situation through the eyes of another. Doing this requires opening the heart: using our feelings and our heart as an organ of tuning in to another person‚Äôs view.
**Generative listening:** We listen for the highest future possibility to show up while holding a space for something new to be born.

_21-Jan-21 03:24 PM_:	That's where the problem starts in my view: missing words! and mixing needs and feelings: [https://static1.squarespace.com/static/527cc9ffe4b06105448def23/t/56e19c91859fd0abcac44ef4/1457626267562/CEG+-+The+_Feelings+and+Needs_+Exercise+030916.pdf](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/527cc9ffe4b06105448def23/t/56e19c91859fd0abcac44ef4/1457626267562/CEG+-+The+_Feelings+and+Needs_+Exercise+030916.pdf)

_26-Jan-21 01:18 PM_:	My thoughts as I'm in this SoftGov meeting: Accountability is the tension between the creation of trust and the resolution of conflict, since something "not done" in a participatory democracy is a kind of "conflict" in a broad sense.

Anyone else have any thoughts on this?

_27-Jan-21 10:42 AM_:	I agree. Lack of accountability breaks trust, and without trust mutual accountability measures might be perceived as aggressive, but people have different thresholds for acquiring or losing trust. It's definitely a puzzle

_22-Jun-21 06:28 AM_: Hi, um I&#39;m not sure if this is a gravity issue, but here we go -
Someone in the server(<span class="pre pre--inline">Coarse#1173) that just entered yesterday invited all of the latest batches of spam scammer bots into the server. We can be sure that it was them, due to our new friend @InviteLogger 

What would be the relevant step forward?

Here&#39;s what I did as a damage control-
- Deleted the invite that they created (<span class="pre pre--inline">FcM5sWSj, as can be seen below that let in 45 bots, and it was a temporary invite so no one notices)
- Banned some of the bots(I&#39;m gonna try and Ban all of them)
- For now, I suspended invite creation and talking permissions from the one who created that invite.

 The invite creator is probably not a bot, and may be a human.
Considering that the style of these messages have been consistent, can it be possible that Coarse is an alternate account of some ill-actor in the server, who keeps inviting these scam bots? Following this, should we <span class="pre pre--inline">prune our members?
Q) What would <span class="pre pre--inline">prune mean?
Ans - It would be removing anyone from the server that hasn&#39;t attended a call, and hasn&#39;t interacted in the server for 3 months.

I didn&#39;t ban Coarse yet, since i was hoping that maybe there can be some dialogue here, or something before we ban them?

_22-Jun-21 04:53 PM_: I have some reservations about the kicking people off the server. I am on serveral discords where I haven&#39;t joined a call or posted to a channel in several months but I do stop in and read to see what&#39;s happening in those projects when I have time. 

Will this precuation be so effective against spammers that it&#39;s worth kicking off real people to achieve it? Does it work well for other projects that do it?

_22-Jun-21 05:09 PM_: hmm, that&#39;s true..
Perhaps, we could use some different approach?
Might be a bit more work though - text these people and see if they reply?

I&#39;m not sure about other projects(1hive atleast doesn&#39;t do a prune)

We could also maybe just not do the prune process, and wait for anyone getting more spam, and then banning the accounts. Usually the spam accounts are temporary(They&#39;re like a one-time raid and dump, that people proliferating the spam buy for 10mins or something and it&#39;s a lot less likely that they&#39;re gonna use the same bots again)

I&#39;ve gone back to working on the <span class="pre pre--inline">TEC Automation bot, and maybe some time soon we will have a process where anyone entering the server would have to go and fill a captcha on the site

Conflict starts in the heart.
Choices have consequences.
Wise-way choices are better than my-way choices.
The blame game makes conflict worse.
Conflict is an opportunity.
The Five A‚Äôs can resolve conflict.
Forgiveness is a choice.

_04-Aug-21 10:14 PM_: I hope it&#39;s okay to pass on some personal experience, and maybe this is already covered for CSTK / TECMNS ...

It&#39;s not always possible for a community to support an individual, there are limits, because the individual also has a responsibility to support themselves, but can struggle with this in certain situations.

Where an individual begins to struggle to support themselves, or has always had difficulties in some respects, community needs to recognise sometimes that specialist skills are needed.

However much I have wanted to be inclusive and involve folk in the autistic spectrum, or folk with hyper sensitivity, I have tended to struggle in dialogue with them, and also it&#39;s very hard to dialogue with folk on the verge of a breakdown for whatever reason.

Sometimes such folk can be in pain, because of their situation, but it&#39;s not possible to help them.

At this point, specialist skills and high levels of compassion are needed, to try to interact in humane yet constructive ways.

Certain organisations I work with are very clear that in extreme circumstances it is necessary to refer folk in distress to professionals, and having this as an option can be really helpful in a community setting.

I hope this is a helpful discussion point, and that I&#39;m putting my point in the right place in the community.

Keen to hear what folk here think about this.

_05-Aug-21 12:21 PM_: I would also point out that we have constructed a society in which SO MANY barriers exist to bringing people back into their own Optimal Arousal Zones, and we also have MANY reasons why we, almost perpetually, prevent people from getting into these optimal states. It&#39;s systemic. For example, &quot;junk food&quot; is almost all people can afford when they are lower income. Given the links of food consumption to mental health, one can start to see the tip of the iceberg. There are MANY such examples.

So, if you KNOW you are being discriminated against, an appropriate response to this is anger, but then that would push you out of the Window Of Tolerance

If you become numb to it, then you are also out of the Window of Tolerance

So, if we are building a monetary structure that is intended to rebalance the extractive manner in which our money is handled, we must know these larger contexts also.

I would point out that I am a significant contributor to the TEC and yet I am a person on the autism spectrum

Ever heard of food deserts? [https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/45014/30940_err140.pdf](https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/45014/30940_err140.pdf) 

These are places where finding good healthy food is challenging, and primarily targets low-income areas.

_10-Aug-21 11:47 PM_: Thank you for replying, this is such a difficult area.

I do think knowledge and awareness are important to this larger discussion, to both sets of people.

What might be needed for example are code words that can be used and some outline constructive responses that mean folk know when they are triggering other folk even accidentally.

This would be some helpful protocol to help folks involved try to see things from the other person&#39;s point of view.

> I agree that food deserts are an issue needing tackling, poverty is so often a trap, and we need to change systems that sit around it and inadvertently feed it.

_13-Aug-21 04:35 AM_: I wanted to share this here first, on a commons basis, alhtough I may need some guidance on that, because of my experiences during the pandemic, and how far I think things have come since 20th century practice ...

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622479917065/875658930582355998/8_-_Inclusive_Community_Management.jpg)

Clearly, I&#39;m seeing DAOs as operating with far more oxygen than some of the other groups I encountered over the past 18 months ... Although there are nuances and circumstances I&#39;m sure in which it makes more sense to operate outside of this description of Inclusive behaviours.

_15-Aug-21 01:36 AM_: Hi @durgadas , I felt moved to make a contribution, above, about inclusive working, which I&#39;m enjoying here in the DAO, does it have some meaning? Likely I&#39;m missing something, so some feedback would be lovely, if you can spare a minute. Thanks.

_15-Aug-21 01:57 PM_: This is an excellent observation. I am trying to see how this might layer into my own graphic above about Gravity-style interacting? How might I add these layers to that?

It does seem relevant to that &#39;flow&#39;

Also, I would perhaps add to the stark duality of this to include something in the middle like &quot;win-win&quot; because it seems to me that real inclusion not only is &quot;free&quot; but there must be a place for reciprocal benefit where we both do well or everyone does well or benefits, even if the benefits are changing according to the &quot;type&quot; aka the 8 forms of wealth: [Sharma: The 8 Forms of Wealth - SUCCESS](https://www.success.com/sharma-the-8-forms-of-wealth/)

_18-Aug-21 07:08 PM_: Hey y&#39;all this is allllllll sortsa up my alley. I found the gravitron spreadsheet and threw my name on it and then i searched through the server and read everything i could find on the topic, same as the blogspace.  [trauma / identity / conflict / neurodiversity / shadow / bias = i geek out real hard on this stuff I believe there are so many overlaps when beings communicate]

How can I become more engaged? I live in PST and have a wicked hard time scheduling globally...its been a steep learning curve for me.

**The book is called Beyond Inclusion Beyond Empowerment - A Developmental Strategy To Liberate Everyone**
 the Author is **Leticia Nieto.**
 I read the first page and uploaded it to soundcloud so I only have to describe the book once when my friends ask. The first page is rich. She did not agree to mentor me...She put me in connection with three mentors who are willing to help me get through this architecture.  I&#39;m Jazzed.

I fumbled some words, no ones perfect.

_03-Sep-21 12:23 AM_: Dear <span class="mention">#&#128330;ÔΩúgravity folk, may I ask a question please?

In the case of conflict management, there may be times when we feel we have insufficient knowledge with a particular situation, or indeed that we feel we cannot give an issue the time it deserves in a particular moment in time.

Is Gravity allowing of such circumstances? Meaning that some disputes might be hard to resource for mediation purposes?

I&#39;m feeling a little guilty over in Twitter that I wanted to opt out of a particular discussion, ducking the issue as it was described.

But we should be able to opt out of or into a situation as capacity and ability allows.

Does Graviton Training address this?

I&#39;m keen on the upcoming Graviton Training, but am hoping that personal circumstances don&#39;t make me a poor candidate.

Thank you.

PS I love the natural instinct @DaveW , who I see already has an abundance of skills doing this, he&#39;d be a fabulous Graviton.

_03-Sep-21 02:58 AM_: I can&#39;t help but respond to this. I encourage gravity like types to engage too.

@innov8tor3 I hope you were able to shake off any guilt you were experiencing, it just is not necessary at all. I am proud of you for speaking up for what you needed. There are conflicts that I don&#39;t put my energy or attention on. I&#39;m still upset about not clarifying the bias that was present in the last kerfuffle I had with an autism activist. 
Some times I choose not to engage because I am putting attention on myself self care. I don&#39;t have to act everytime I see an occurrence. 

I generally have the capacity and desire to turn towards conflict but that&#39;s in part because I&#39;ve experienced a profound amount of it since birth. The other part is it gets easier with experience. 

Lastly you said you were ducking our of the issue...
I don&#39;t believe this to be a truth in grounded in reality and I also don&#39;t want to gaslight your experience but I want to note that I know you did the right thing. You noticed that you were being upset by the posts and spoke up. You didn&#39;t attack anyone which is rare these days with folx. Besides there were a handful of eyes and voices engaged. 

I&#39;m glad you mentioned what you have here...all of it. 
I am absolutely certain there will be an opt out if someone is not up for a conflict. (It would be unrealistic to attempt anything different) The alternative is subjecting yourself to further activation which could be a re traumatization depending on the sensitivity of ones brain and nervous system. 

I hope that a bunch of people will show up for this training that way there are so many people holding the various lenses needed to catch people in crisis. Also plenty of backup/ rotation for burnout. 

There are a bunch of classes ...you don&#39;t need to memorize it all...you pull out the threads that you were meant to carry and trust that the collective will gather the rest. Together we can hold it all. Power of community.

_03-Sep-21 04:55 AM_: Thank you, I really appreciate this!

You are clearly a very caring soul, and we certainly need more like you!

I do agree with you about trauma, it can often make us respond sub-optimally, but on the other hand we can become more empathetic.

Again, thank you!

_06-Sep-21 01:51 PM_: Oh yes, for sure, the will of the parts and the competence of the Graviton are really important parts of Gravity&#39;s alternative conflict management process. in the role design of the Graviton, we propose certain exigences that need to be respected to participate in facilitating cases

[Gravity - Role design](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/gravity-role-design/174)

> Gravity role design Epic: [https://github.com/TECommons/coordination/issues/130](https://github.com/TECommons/coordination/issues/130)   Rules and boundaries are key for managing Common Pool Resources, and monitoring gives legitimacy to agreements toward maintaining trust and collective goodwill.  We are proposing a mutual-monitoring system, where each one of us can inform any issue (through the Gravi...
ffd103eeda16b5f36d93f2909785859dd9ee73cb.png">

Gravity members must commit to additional exigences that are required to join and stay in the collective. Such as:

Voluntary Process: All members in the Gravity group participate without coercion from any actor.

Self-Determination: Recognize the ability to promote voluntary agreements. The mediator facilitates the management of disputes but the outcomes belong to the parties.

Conflict of interest: Recognize when they are not capable of facilitating a conversation for any possible bias reason, personal or professional.

Competence: As we are a community of experts, the mediator, besides being trained in Alternative Dispute Resolution, should be able to prove deep understanding of the specific topics that the dispute may be about.

Confidentiality: Information related to these processes should be handled privately, and strategically shared with the agreement by the parties. Unwanted information filtered by the mediator is a reason to remove from the Gravity group.

Impartiality and neutrality: The Gravity group members should lead by their example of empathy and acceptance of different points of view, with freedom from favouritism.

Professional Responsibility: Gravity members should assume the task of mediating in the organization with diplomacy and prudence.

Rotation: Three times a year, new training and selection processes will be run to encourage members of the community to become part of the Gravity team. One can only be in this group for three years in a row, to avoid accumulation of power.

We have a variety of Gravitons, and according to the case, we can include persons who can feel competent, self determined, without conflict of interest, confidential, impartial and professionally responsible for their role as mediator.

> Dear <span class="mention">#&#128330;ÔΩúgravity folk, may I ask a question please?

In the case of conflict management, there may be times when we feel we have insufficient knowledge with a particular situation, or indeed that we feel we cannot give an issue the time it deserves in a particular moment in time.

Is Gravity allowing of such circumstances? Meaning that some disputes might be hard to resource for mediation purposes?

I&#39;m feeling a little guilty over in Twitter that I wanted to opt out of a particular discussion, ducking the issue as it was described.

But we should be able to opt out of or into a situation as capacity and ability allows.

Does Graviton Training address this?

I&#39;m keen on the upcoming Graviton Training, but am hoping that personal circumstances don&#39;t make me a poor candidate.

Thank you.

PS I love the natural instinct @DaveW , who I see already has an abundance of skills doing this, he&#39;d be a fabulous Graviton.

_07-Sep-21 12:42 PM_: I did the Graviton training for my personal development.
Because you&#39;ve had the training doesn&#39;t obligate you to use your training whenever a conflict arises.
I think I&#39;m reading the question correctly?

_08-Sep-21 03:51 AM_: Wow! You guys blow me away with the work that&#39;s been done, and on a collective basis too! Consensus is so hard to achieve!

I think it&#39;s great, can we share this with other folk who want to understand what is involved?

I have &quot;only&quot; two questions at this point:

1. What does this mean, please ...

&quot;Unwanted information filtered by the mediator is a reason to remove from the Gravity group&quot;

2. In the impartiality section, the difficulty comes where a decision might have to favour one party or another in any dispute, which might seem to mitigate against the impartiality. Are there rules / processes for where folk want to appeal against the decision, based on a &quot;feeling&quot; around unintentional bias? I&#39;m guessing transparency of process, but within confidentiality bounds, must play a part ...

(I couldn&#39;t find another way to express that with the vocabulary I have become aware of)

Vocabulary plays a factor in conflict. It is often linked to ones awareness which can only be raised by exposure. Our environments affect our behavior, our social conditioning is what makes us get crunchy in social situations. 

I love this stuff.

_21-Sep-21 03:05 PM_: Fantastic job @Juankbell 

Two observations:

1) I feel like I&#39;ve come home here in TEC / Gravity, I even chat with Dave Snowden over in FB, and already a big Ostrom fan ...

2) Listening today, I&#39;m already starting to understand the chaos, assumed justice systems and unresolved conflicts in other DAOs ...

Again, I&#39;m so glad to be here!

**11. How do I claim a POAP?**

<div class="quote">When you attend a POAP-sponsored event, the organizer will distribute claim codes in the form of QR codes or URLs. Scan the QR code or enter the URL in your browser to claim the POAP using your Ethereum address, or enter your email to reserve the POAP so you can claim it at a later time.
So just wait until either the Discord bot works or a link for the claim code is sent to you manually.

_22-Sep-21 12:05 AM_: The best training is the sort that is put to work immediately to embed the learning.

I see Twitter disputes regularly, and love Twitter, and don&#39;t want to see it spoiled by disputes.

So @Juankbell , do you think there is an echo from the Cynefin model here, of trying to see the complexity in a situation (Tokens Vs Holochain Vs Bitcoin) and trying for a solution that might pacify passionate advocates on 3 sides?

(A three deep thread response ...)

[https://twitter.com/innov8tor3/status/1440522177606914049?s=19](https://twitter.com/innov8tor3/status/1440522177606914049?s=19) 

Also, I haven&#39;t seen it yet, but that point about putting learning into action straight away is critical for folk to really take learning on board and for it to stick.

Blooms Taxonomy was my inspiration there, made a huge difference to me and underpinned much of my approach to learning online.

And yes, needs a horizontal presentation as a journey not a &quot;climb to the top&quot;, but does indicate that many people give up on that journey at different stages, not pushing through to the rather wonderful conclusion of synthesis.

Maybe the Blooms model is there but just intrinsic, rather than overt?

> @wor @HOLOptik @Hessu357 @dilgreen @T_Fleischman @matslats @tecmns I agree üíØ%.

For 5 years, we had - IMHO, of course - some decent EduTech software. The issue was we needed to convince marketplace incumbents to give the software a try, to adopt.

Soft skills were key: presentation, persuasion, negotiation,  ...

Complexity Vs Fragmented ...

_22-Sep-21 12:08 AM_: Ooh thanks!

How can I pin a Discord note for later reference, please?

Also, did TEC decide against using Notion, on the grounds of overhead and chaos?

_22-Sep-21 12:28 AM_: Maybe you guys can solve a problem I&#39;m having?

I see three styles of Discord Comms:

1) Snap comments - pure dialogue
2) Structured thinking - connecting aspects together
3) &quot;Unstructured&quot; thinking - thinking out loud often emotionally

My style is typically 2), though I can use 1).

Some DAOs actively dislike 2), prefer 1), and miss the opportunity for deeper dialogue that 2) offers, IMV.

And then with 3), I find my style, trying to seek the sources of pain I hear in 3), just doesn&#39;t work with 3) style dialogue people. My failing, I strongly suspect.

(I&#39;m loving the Graviton Training already!)

But can Gravitons work asynch as well, on specific problems - again, my belief, this can offer faster progress - and if so where is a good place to do that?

Thanks!

OK, so now I&#39;m learning about Community Management &amp; Governance with you guys, I want to put knowledge to work ASAP rocky! Always my bad habit, wanting to run ASAP, not sure yet if I know how to walk.

Hearing @durgadas talk about confusion in other communities, and having the same experience myself, I wondered whether a perspective on our collective TEC travels might be helpful. Folk here are very welcome to use this, it&#39;s an amalgam of stuff that&#39;s already out there in the big blue web. I don&#39;t know yet about the full toolkit here of course, and happy to work on better comms and approaches.

Love to hear your thoughts, you guys!

Oh ...  PS ... These DAO confusions are opportunities for TEC, if and only if the partner DAO is seeing the need, and TEC have planted seeds / stated capabilities in a succinct enough fashion.

5m summary of first session from yesterday, from the Governance WG in the TEC Gravity DAO.

Mind blowing, and there are 9 more sessions !!!

Includes a definite side reference to discord - the word, not the tech - in communities, of any size, including very small communities!

TEC clearly see that community building is key to creative development, and this can help other groups I&#39;m working with.

Thanks.

_28-Sep-21 03:04 PM_: Holi, I&#39;m LB and I&#39;m from the SourceCred community. Conflict makes me so uncomfortable, but I&#39;ve gained a lot of resilience to it through the building up of our space at SC. I joined this because Aloysious told me about it and when I took a look I could tell these were skills I wanted to have, both for my work in Web3 but also just for myself as a human being.

_28-Sep-21 03:09 PM_: Hey folks! I am Maggie (they/them pronouns), also from SourceCred, also here because of Aloysious&#39; invitation üíú 

I am here because I was very much raised in an environment where conflict was very present while simultaneously feared and avoided. I wasn&#39;t raised with tools to be able to be in a healthy relationship with conflict and as a result it is often very activating/triggering for me, and I am excited about building a healthier relationship with it so I can be a part of being in healthier communities. So many things that were shared today were so helpful for shifting my embodied stories about conflict.. This quote (and really everything else on the slide) hit me real deep, &quot;One way to truly know our humanness is to recognize the gift of conflict in our lives. Without it, life would be a monotonously flat topography of sameness and our relationships would be woefully superficial.&quot;

Knic here ‚Äî any pronouns for me are fine! i default to they/them.

i am about to get in a car and won‚Äôt be able to introduce myself in live time.

i help organize communities, love performing music, and often serve as default tech support for folx. 

this course is already helpful for me to consider viewing conflict as a generative force, and seeing peace as embedded within justice. 

thanks for a full and expanding session today, @Juankbell

## October 2021

 _02-Oct-21 11:54 AM_:

I&#39;m curious what I&#39;m agreeing to down the road when it comes to processes/the communication architecture piece in the conflict resolution process.  

Where might I find the documents we will be using to support conflict?

Where do I find the processes we will be using to make decisions?

_05-Oct-21 03:12 PM_: Regarding pathways for inclusion (which we discussed in the gravity session): 
I personally feel that the TEC sometimes uses a very specific terminology (words like Cynefin) or very dense info graphics  referring to dense concepts. 
Not knowing much about these concepts can make people feel excluded.
Perhaps, a simpler lingo or more explanations/examples would be helpful to include new people in discussions about such topics.
I also see that this can slow down discussions for more experienced members because this densely packed terms are certainly faster in communicating information.

_05-Oct-21 03:17 PM_: Something I was saying in group 6 (I believe/the one with Nate lol) when the time went up, is that we have a saying that &quot;the shape of an organization inform how the relationships are structured&quot;. In an hierarchical org, the labels of the roles create a superior-subordinate relationship, which them creates scarcity - restricting the activities one might actually take part etc. 
In a DAO space, I see that we intend to create a fluid and horizontal shape, bringing more abundance of roles and possibilities.
Nonetheless, we are sometimes so embedded in a hierarchical society that our mental models struggle to adapt and we end up replicating some limiting beliefs even in a DAO, which might resonate sometimes in a struggle to see where one can contribute/benefit because of the different structure.
I&#39;m not saying that we need some sort of hierarchy, on the contrary.. I think everyone wanting to participate in a DAO might take some time to reflect and observe their own behavior regarding structured-unstructured relationships, because it involves a lot of emotional awareness

_05-Oct-21 03:18 PM_: Thanks everyone who joined today&#39;s Gravity session. The two scenarios we explored in breakout groups were:

**Creating spirals into and out of positions of greater responsibility.**

Ideas for this could include: rituals of honouring and appreciation, time-bound roles, advisor roles that people can step into, supported hiatus (or offboarding) periods and clear processes on how to do that, and knowledge sharing tools that pass over key information to those that step into new roles so those leaving know they can safely pass their role on.
 
**Creating various pathways for inclusion, participation, and autonomy.**

Ideas for this could include: groups of various sizes, clear internal information pathways, time-bound roles, maximum group sizes, setting up pods or crews (small groups of not more than 7 that meet regularly with a particular focus), facilitated spaces for difficult community conversations about power, hierarchies, social capital, gender, and inclusion, and spaces in calls for reflection and contemplation.

_05-Oct-21 03:18 PM_: Here are the notes from group 3 @G0RD0 (unfortunately missed a username. if u see this say üëã )

few highlights from what i&#39;ve absorbed: 
- creating a culture of mutual care &amp; letting go. a culture that welcomes vulnerability. 
- On boarding: a role which keeps a close look on newcomers, establish personal contact &amp; understand the needs (specially for marginalized ppl).  Someone who has gotten in touch diverse backgrounds. 
- Off boarding: gratitude / continuity check 

praise thom for taking notes :D

_05-Oct-21 11:14 PM_: One of the previous 2 Graviton sessions covered Cynefin in outline, which is basically the journey from Confusion to Clarity.

It is possible to look up those previous sessions for Graviton Season 2 by finding the sessions on YouTube, searching for &quot;token engineering commons&quot; , filtering / sorting using most recent, and looking back over the previous two Tuesdays ...

Another option is to Google the 3D version of Cynefin on Google Images, which has a really neat diagram that explains the Cynefin journey in more detail.

I agree with you, a jump from one step to a later step means that missed steps and discussion leads to later confusion, I get this myself, quite a lot.

Has this been of some help?

_06-Oct-21 07:50 AM_: Cynefin was just an example for such a term. I also attended the second gravity and heard about the concepts. Still, in discussions - even more as a non-native speaker - it might be hard to follow if many of those terms are thrown around.

i screwed up and lost my recovery phrase for my ethereum wallet (which i created to mint POAPs for this course ‚Äî fortunately will not lose access to anything else!). i will not make this mistake again.

i do still have the Ethereum address for the wallet i lost access to. 

the options i can figure out:

1. i can continue minting POAPs into that wallet, i just won&#39;t have access to the wallet to &quot;spend&quot; anything. maybe that doesn&#39;t matter?
2. i can make a new wallet, receive the remaining POAPs, and shrug off the first four.
3. or perhaps there&#39;s a way to easily generate new tokens for the first four POAPs?

does anyone have a suggestion on the best way to move forward? 
(would especially love guidance from @ALOYSIOUS, as y&#39;all seem to be very familiar with these nuts and bolts. not an assignment, however! no pressure or expectation.)

thank you for understanding my ignorance, and for your time reading this.

_13-Oct-21 01:29 PM_: thanks to all who came for yesterdays session! 

I hope to make it for the remainder of the book club, and intend to continue producing \ modularizing NVC materials for Gravity

> Question for the room:

i screwed up and lost my recovery phrase for my ethereum wallet (which i created to mint POAPs for this course ‚Äî fortunately will not lose access to anything else!). i will not make this mistake again.

i do still have the Ethereum address for the wallet i lost access to.

_14-Oct-21 08:31 AM_: Hey @knic ! all possibilities sound good. 

1. you can continue collecting the POAPs of the training in the account you lost keys because they will only be used as certification of becoming a Graviton (with 6+)
2. we could keep in mind that you used two accounts, and count the ones you already have in that account with the ones you will continue claiming in the new address.
3. This is the hardest one because on some of this sessions all the links generated were used and distributed.

- Thank god you didn&#39;t have funds there, we all have had this kind of shocks. (once i sent some Eth to a proxy contract - Thankfully @griff (&#128156;, &#128156;) helped me to recover them)

_14-Oct-21 08:58 AM_: @Juankbell this is incredibly helpful, thank you so much for taking the time. i‚Äôll do #1, that sounds overall the simplest approach.

i‚Äôll try hard to not lose my keys on my next wallet! üòù üèª

PRESENTATION / WORKSHOP

Intro: Acknowledgement of our teachers &amp; the legacy of circle-based justice built by millenia of pre-colonial cultures

Restorative Justice Theory: Dispute resolution can be fully decentralized, and what does fully decentralized mean

Are you in an org currently? Do you have a stated conflict process? Would you know what to do if a team conflict arose?
Brainstorm what types of conflict resolution can you think of? Is there a centralized party in each of these?
Why doesn‚Äôt centralization work? (Review current justice systems)
Go over quotes from FTP and D. Barter
Practical Implementation: How to set up a conflict res process in your org

Selecting a method
Facilitators
Training for Facilitators
Team agreement to use the method
Time resolving conflict is paid time
Company culture: Celebrate conflict!

_19-Oct-21 04:26 PM_: We have been doing the homework!
1.  Gravity proposes a method.
2. gravitons are facilitators. 
3. Gravity trains gravitons, 
4.  promote agreement of applying the method (or others) 
5. (mid term) become DAO that rewards energy spent on this activities 
6.  Develop culture of competence and understanding of promoting trust and managing conflict.

_21-Oct-21 11:59 PM_: Dear Gravity folk, 

I saw a nice crypto guide recently, about exchange and wallets, but then I felt the following sections were relevant and could or should be referenced, from an Ostrom perspective ...

&quot;1. Earning Crypto
2. Community Contribution
3. Working Asynch

Rationale, TLDR follows ...

Rationale ...

1. Earning capability means there is something to exchange. Without this it is exclusionary to &quot;have not&quot;s, because they cannot participate.

2. So as to earn, folk need to be able to make a contribution. This is surprisingly difficult, when folk are working at distance from one another.

3. The human need to work face to face does matter, but in an asynch setting we need to get better at asynch working. This is not impossible, people have managed this using email for decades, and changing to chat should not be an impassable barrier. It&#39;s particularly relevant in DAOs because the need to meet face to face gets harder for older folk, who have family demands to meet, meaning less time available. This is normally overcome by a human tendency to throw money when time is not available, but not everyone has spare money to throw around. The grey workforce has much to contribute, but some difficult working constraints.&quot;

Would love your thoughts on this, if you feel okay to do so.

_02-Nov-21 03:14 PM_: Interesting to understand the concept of leadership when contrasted against organisations run in a decentralised way ...   This must be a challenge, to create direction, but to have folk follow willingly ...

_02-Nov-21 03:14 PM_: [Servant leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership) 

> Servant leadership is a leadership philosophy in which the  goal of the leader is to serve. This is different from traditional leadership where the leader&#39;s main focus is the thriving of their company or organizations. A servant leader shares power, puts the needs of the employees first and helps people develop and perform as highly as possible....

_02-Nov-21 03:35 PM_: One of my favourites, bottom up leadership, supportive leadership ...

At times, leaders need to ask followers for support, a leader needs to be able to see when this is needed, else progress can become less possible ...

Assigning roles helps folk see what they can do, it does help, but equally they need to agree that role

<h4>innov8tor3 <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/530682470232883210/193353ccfcbc44b9892dbb7a5862c455.png" width="25" height="25" /></h4>

_02-Nov-21 03:54 PM_: Can we transcend our own typical characteristic, use a different persona when we need to, so as to return closer to the goal we are pursuing?

Is goal alteration evidence of some kind of progress?

I think forming is a response to chaos. We see chaos and as a leadership response say we need to do something ...

Leadership always involves compromise, and so cannot be perfect!

A leader wants to be led by others who understand leadership!

_13-Nov-21 12:10 AM_: I think one organisational driver here is community building.

I suspect, with some inspection, that there will be more commonalities in approach with S3.

What can often happen in research and development is that one researcher will take a particular path, choosing particular factors, and using different language.

End outcomes can sound different, but have similarities. And yet still folk will lean one way or the other.

If you haven&#39;t looked at Elinor Ostrom yet, and her 8 principles, that will give you one of the founding drivers here ... And another founding factor is autonomy, meaning adapting theory to local practical use.

I&#39;m still learning, so I don&#39;t have a complete picture.

_16-Nov-21 02:39 PM_: I don&#39;t appreciate when my autonomy is taken away because people are conditioned by thier enviornments. 

For instance when I offer 1000$ to a friend in dire need of money...they can&#39;t take it from me because they know im black and that they experience priveledge so it would be unethical based on the racial theory they are holding.

_16-Nov-21 03:02 PM_: Hi Gravitons! I&#39;m curious if there is a directory of available conflict facilitators coming out of this group? 
I&#39;m looking for people who have either actively facilitated multiple different conflicts, or are deeply trained in a specific modality.
Would be great to see names &amp; contact info next to the modality that facilitator practices.

Occasionally I need to recommend facilitators that aren&#39;t me &amp; I&#39;d like to have a phonebook of who I can call upon.

(ps: didn&#39;t mean to post this while a class session &amp; some really important reactions are happening... it was just coincidence. hope i&#39;m not taking away from the focus at hand. I&#39;ll make this a thread so that the replies don&#39;t distract)

but @ryeder (they/them) is right, if all links have been claimed maybe there have been some people claiming them without coming to the sessions

i am going to make a review of the claims to make the list of the people that actually participated

 There&#39;s a poap bot specifically for issuing them perhaps for the next session [&amp; TEC events] we could use that.

However, there&#39;s another bot made by BanklessDAO - DEGEN, that we might be using

You have had lots of people attending the Graviton training. Could you survey them about what they want to do next? Would that be a part of the next steps on a Tuesday?

_26-Nov-21 07:52 PM_: üìå <em>the thought spiral</em>

A method I&#39;m pondering in regards to praise or gratitude practices...a weekly rotation where each member gets a new person in the community to praise each week.

How it could possibly be automated:
A bot that holds profiles for each community member maybe this looks like a photo, their working projects, the projects/daos etc. 

Then you can find the person you&#39;re praising in working threads or server maybe? 

These thoughts are in response to the natural habit of preferences developing when people gather and how inequalities can emerge from these habits habits if not accounted for. Same people praising the same people....

^^^ thoughts for rewards group. Curious what people here think. I feel like cultural practices and behavior is a good topic for jamming on?

_29-Nov-21 03:39 AM_: One cultural practice that could help is online profiles, if folk wish to do that.

I agree entirely with you about projects people are working on, I see this as hugely helpful aligning with folk to buddy together, and form larger groups, or #clusters as they are known.

If I could find folk here working on similar projects, we could begin to start submitting smarter proposals, with greater speed, because many hands make light work.

And yes, there may be differences individually, but the Graviton Training will help us resolve those differences and find workable compromise.

If not, could this be a task for a Graviton task force? I could transcribe for one video, but don&#39;t fancy doing all ten!

Also, is there an agenda for discussion this coming Tuesday evening (UK time), assuming the plan for Tuesday evenings is still to continue meeting?

_01-Dec-21 04:55 AM_: Thanks for yesterday, @Juankbell .

Great point about making progress between meetings, which often is easier for me than attending in person.

It was great to hear @chuygarcia.eth offer Comms support, which would certainly help in terms of the YouTube Graviton transcripts. I&#39;m happy to do at least some of grunt work, but would definitely appreciate some polish, my writing is not the most gifted!

Is Otter an option to get the basic scripts from YouTube? Other software also works, I&#39;m not prescriptive, given the UX is relatively intuitive.

And then I can write some synopses to add to the YouTube videos.

I&#39;m still learning about protocols here, and folks&#39; working patterns, so please suggest how you want to proceed, Juan.

@ALOYSIOUS , I think you might be interested, maybe in joining in with a bit of weaving? Or at least observing and commenting, I value your views as well.

_07-Dec-21 09:14 AM_: Hey @Juankbell !

1) I presume we are meeting tonight?

I&#39;ve done some research / work mean time, testing out Otter against the G2S1 session in YouTube. So far I have transcribed the first half hour.

Once I have transcripts we can produce synopses.

If more people are involved producing transcripts, we can get the job done sooner!

Just a thought.

FYI @chuygarcia.eth 

2) Second, Juanke, I am inviting someone into TEC where I have noted an online dispute spilling over into Twitter &amp; the DAOist Server.

This seems quite a complicated dispute, so I feel some experienced Gravitons would be best assessing the case. I am happy to be involved, but nervous if my first case isn&#39;t quite a simple one, and have synchronous UK evening limits that I feel will curtail my contribution. I think technical expertise will be needed, for sure.

FYI @durgadas 

Let me know what I can do next.

The ‚Äúpower‚Äù lies within the words we use. 
Understanding this and implementing acquired wisdom makes our voice non violent.

We need to learn about autonomy / consent
We need to have a collective understanding of boundaries as they apply to consent
This will influence folx understanding of parameters

And then we can talk about parameters . . .
And perhaps the fact that everyone learns differently and some people will need 1:1 support to ensure inclusivity.

And by allowing this fast paced push, we give in to &quot;Moloch&quot;. We give in to chaos. We give in to entropy. We give in to, what at the heart it truly is, fear.

_07-Dec-21 02:34 PM_: So, my Virtuous Cycles tries to recognize the push/pull of doing and taking time for ourselves. Withdrawing and giving consent to use of certain amounts of time for this or for that. In many ways, it aligns with /r/antiwork on Reddit, in the sense that we need to be aware of HOW much we&#39;ve turned into colonizers of our own time. In many ways, our own efforts in TEC or other communities is an attempt to find a way to be fiscally free enough to have more autonomy of our time. This Faustian bargain is one we must be aware of in order to change society.

A while back I adapted the term Radical Rest into my vocabulary thinking about my orientation towards time and the pressures of capitalism and the labor force in general. I saw so many times when we would as a culture move past peoples concerns and discomforts attuning to time over the person and their needs. It&#39;s exhausting to witness this energy occurring so much. I want everyone to lave access to liquidity so they have safety to slow down and care for themselves. Some people still need to learn to value themselves but their mental and emotional development has been slowed by being involved in the labor industry / mindset.

_08-Dec-21 04:42 AM_: Thank you for your consideration . I can perhaps construct a guideline on how to do this, suitable for a smal Graviton group, but I wonder where it would fit in with the Graviton content base.

My Faustian contract is in two parts, BTW. Firstly my age, I want to help as much as possible while I am still able. Secondly I am concerned that folk will derail the DAO movement, for all those commercial and time based reasons, and that timely response to this is important, to show there is another path.

Lifting above the heated debate is important, but also good enough communication to show this is not in a detached way. That&#39;s a challenge for me, and where I would look to skilled comnunicators for support.

_15-Dec-21 03:02 AM_: Apologies I could not attend yesterday, but a quick update on the Graviton Series 2 YT videos.

I&#39;ve transcribed forty minutes of G2S1, using Otter.ai, and  proof read and tidied 25 minutes.

The proof reading isn&#39;t quick work.

Once the proof reading is done, I can use copy.ai in a burst - it&#39;s only free for a trial period - to get synopses that can be used for the videos.

I will then put everything in a Google folder for folk to take a look.

But it could take a while.

FYI @durgadas

_15-Dec-21 03:12 AM_: There are times, though, and some people, where this isn&#39;t possible, do you agree?

We can suspend judgement where people are willing to talk and be reasonable.

If they are outright uncooperative, what do we do then?

_21-Dec-21 02:49 PM_: I have two questions ...

Lots of ideas, lots of proposals. Are we best shaping and storing these in GitHub?

Second, how are folk best to volunteer? In an AMA? IIn the Gravity channel?

My background is process design, specific tasks, to some extent I can liaise with the Comms team, if that would help.
