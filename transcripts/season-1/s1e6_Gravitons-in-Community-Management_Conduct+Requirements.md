## Transcript

(00:00:00)
**Juan Carlos**:    This session is going to be a deep dive on the conflict management platform that gravity is building. Also what are the requirements for gravity. 

Also it's very important to understand the code of conduct to be framed by the last session with Livi, and following the application Ostrom's principles, we have decided to take care of our rules and boundaries looking for the wellbeing of the community. 

This code of conduct is a really important document that I think that Gravitons should be familiar with. Instead of defending points of view, we can refer to the code of conduct as a source of legitimacy. 

I want to present you what we are doing and what are going to be the rules and boundaries that will give shape to the code of conduct. Then we are going to talk about the participation in community management. 

Then we will go a little bit on the forum post that has been made in the forum on gravity to also understand the work that we have been doing and of how are gravitons going to work. 

I always love to start with a meme and really that we are trying to bring here. A way to frame behavior and to set some rules for every of the members. 

## Value-Aligned Conduct

> The TEC operates from a *prosocial*, *human centered* perspective:
> 
> * **Prosocial** - We value designs that create public goods over profit. Profit is not bad, on the contrary, it is critical towards our goal of creating a regenerative economy that supports the Token Engineering community, but providing services to support the TE community is more important than making a profit.
> 
> * **Human centered** - We encourage initiatives that are focused on using token engineering in an ethical manner, and strive to only create positive impact.

The TEC, we have a value aligned code of conduct. The TEC operates from prosocial principles. 

It's also very important for other communities to try to frame their themselves between principles and a judgment made by a group of people, but by some principles associated to the values that of the organization. Good over profit. 

Profit is not bad. On the contrary, it is critical towards our goal of creating economy that support the token in the engineering community, but providing services to support the TE community is more important than making a profit. 

Also we are human centered. We encourage initiatives that are and strive to only create positive impact.  

### We hold ourselves to high standards of safety, resilience, and integrity:

* *Safety* - Everyone should feel safe to be, interact and express their opinions and contributions free from any malicious reaction.  
* *Resilience* - We ask members of this community to communicate openly and to make an effort to maintain alignment with the TEC vision, mission and values. If conflicts arise, we expect members to act peacefully towards a resolution and the restoration of harmony and efficiency. If needed,  Loie from the Commons Stack can facilitate a conflict resolution process.
* *Integrity* - Honesty and consistency lead to trust, which is a core value of healthy communities. Our approach is to trust first, and any instances of scam, mislead, spam or defraud will be treated as a violation of this code of conduct.

We hold ourselves to high standards of safety, resilience, and express their opinions and contributions free from any malicious reaction resilience. We ask members of this community to communicate openly and to make an effort to maintain if conflict arises. 

We expect members to like peacefully towards a resolution and the restoration of harmony and efficiency. Integrity, honesty and consistency lead to trust, which is a core value of healthy communities. 

### We encourage our members to be radically open source, non-hierarchical, creative, transparent in their intentions and accountable for their actions

> * *Open source* - Ideas are meant to be shared. We default to using GPLv3 and Creative Commons with attribution licensing on our work, but we accept all open source licenses. 
> * *Non-hierarchical* - Everyone is encouraged to exercise their autonomy, creativity and full agency when acting in the Commons. Every individual is wise in their own manner and the diversity of perspectives enriches our Commons. 
> * *Transparent* - We value individuals' efforts to act transparently, and to proactively identify their incentives, especially if there are conflicts of interest, especially when it comes to proposing, funding, work progress and other important activities involving the TE Commons.
> * *Accountable* - Community members are expected to be accountable for all their actions and commitments. Accountability brings trust and trusting in each other is critical for our success. 

Our approach is to trust first and any instance of scam, misleading spam, or fraud will be treated as a violation of this code of conduct. 

Why did I take the time to read all these? Because sometimes we like forget our values, and it's very important to understand that here is not like what one person says is that we have these values and in, within our values, we are talking about, about accepting the difference about respecting each other about being value driven about being a human centered. 

These are like the basis and the basic understanding that we are going to try to reproduce in every interaction of the TEC. 

### We are value driven, (not profit driven) and will strive to support token engineering projects that appreciate the value of public goods and ethical, inclusive economic systems.

> * *Value Driven* -  we encourage members to support the TE field more so than the opportunity for token values to rise
> * *Token Engineering projects* - organized action towards designing sustainable cripto economic systems 
> * *Public goods* - subject of collective action problems. Can also be seen as Common Pool Resources

That's why it's really important for gravitons not only to understand these values, but also to replicate them and to behave according to them in their role that is very aligned and very associated to community management. 

The role of easing communication is also very related to the community management. That is why I am really happy to say that the new discord that we are going to migrate to is going to be moderated by gravity and by gravitons, and with the help of transparency. 

### What actions can be taken in this medium? 
> * Everyone in the community can fill the Gravity [typeform](https://the-commons-stack.typeform.com/to/rCVsK5RK) or approach any of the gravitons to request support for conflicts and any sort of uncomfortable or undesired situations. 
> * In case of conflict, Gravitons can approach the parties involved to collect information on the issues. 
> * Gravitons can take actions to [regulate unwanted behavior according to the graduated sanctions](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/scale-of-conflicts-graduated-sanction-guideline/234).  
> * All community members can propose new methodologies to approach graduated sanctions and mutual monitoring as well as upgrade current ones through Advice Process and Forum Voting. 
> * Gravitons can submit conflicts or issues to the Gravity Registry, that is a database of the cases managed by gravity.
> * Conflict resolution calls and chats are closed to Gravitons and parties involved to respect privacy and vulnerability. 
> * The Gravity working group can host training and capacitate individuals to become Gravitons.
> * The Gravity training is free and open for all. 
> * Gravity can remove proposals from all the voting categories if they receive flaggins and/or are seen as harmful for the community based on our rules, boundaries, T&C’s and Code of Conduct.   


It's very important that the members of these groups are also a reflection. Also that they lead with the example of acting according to these values, because it wouldn't have any sense to have graviton that don't follow the code of conduct of the organization.

Instead of that, to be a graviton, we will have additional requirement different to the requirements of the normal members in the organization. What are the additional requirements that we have in the gravity code of conduct?  

We decided to make this approximation to a code of conduct for the different platforms that we use, what Ostrom says that is that sometimes we don't include what is required when we are making rules. We only make rules thinking on what is allowed and what is forbidden. 

Here we tried also to add an important thing of what is required to join and stay in the collective. What actions can be taking in gravity, everyone in the community can fill the gravity type form or approach any of the gravity to request support for conflict and any sort of support or on the side situations. 

In case of conflict, gravitons can approach the parties involved to collect information on the issues. Graviton can take actions to regulate unwanted behavior. According to the graduated sanctions, all community members can propose new methodologies to approach graduated sanctions and mutual monitoring, as well as a great current ones. 

Through advice process and forum voting gravity can submit conflicts or issues to the gravity registry. That is a database of the case managed by gravity conflict resolution calls and chats are closed to gravity and parties involved to respect privacy and vulnerability. 

The gravity working group can host trainings and capacitating individuals to become gravity. The gravity training is free and open for all. Gravity can remove proposals from all the voting categories, if they receive flaggings or are seen as harmful for the community, based on our rules, boundaries terms, and conditions and code of conduct.  

### Now what are the requirements and what is discouraged or forbidden? 

> #### Is this action or outcome required?
> - All members should act in acknowledgment of the [guidelines for scale of conflict and graduated sanctions](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/scale-of-conflicts-graduated-sanction-guideline/234)
> - Gravitons should comply to the code of conduct of the TEC and the additional [Graviton Code of Conduct](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/gravity-role-design/174) 
> - Gravitons should accept cases based on their competence and communicate to the Gravity group if they don’t feel capable of handling an issue. 
> - Gravitons should promote trust and good relationships between the community
> - It is required to complete the [Gravity Training](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/graviton-training/217) successfully to become a Graviton.
> - Gravitons will update the Gravity Registry with the information of possible agreements
> - All members should commit to respect the protocol for [TEC calls](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/protocol-for-tec-calls/186)
> - Respect the arrangements made about the situations issued
> 
> #### Is this action or outcome discouraged? 
> 
> - Using the confidential Gravity information to serve personal interest (that leads to expulsion of the Gravity group)
> - Violating the requirements for the [Graviton Role](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/gravity-role-design/174) (Any member can monitor Gravitons actions and report to other Gravitons, fill in the typeform, or contact community stewards.

The requirements are that all members should act in acknowledgement of the guidelines for a scale of conflict and graduated sanctions that will go over them in a moment. 

Graviton should comply to the code of conduct to of the TEC and the additional graviton code of conduct graviton should accept case cases based on their competence and communicate to the gravity working group. 

If they don't feel capable of having an issue, graviton should promote trust and good relationship between the community. It is required to complete. The graviton will update the gravity registry with the information of possible agreement. 

All members should commit to respect the protocol for TEC calls and respect the arrangements made about the situations issued. These are like the rules that we are going to follow in in gravity.  

We all are making this training to become Gravitons and no one can become a Graviton without being in this training. I think that we will need some, some like new roadmap to integrate some of the new ideas that graviton that you can can have for improving this training and for improving this program. 

The idea of all that is that when we have this organization made, we can then go out and offer our services to other organizations. 

What is discouraged in for gravity, using confidential gravity information to serve personal interest that will lead to expulsion from the gravity group, and because any member can monitor gravity actions and report to other gravity feel in the type form or contact community steroids, and like the gravitons as all of the members of the organization are engaged in this mutual monitoring. 

Gravitons can also be reported to another graviton or to be at a type form or contacting another community steward for telling some behavior or unwanted behavior that the graviton is producing or any conflict that may involve a graviton.  

### Protocol for TEC meetings - Common rules for all calls:

> - *Nonviolent communication is the common rule* (assertive, careful language)
> - *Humbleness of knowledge* (not trying to impose own perspective)
> - Respect the *moderation* (The moderator can stop interventions if considered)
> - Respect to the *time and topics of the agenda*
> - Respect the *others integrity*
> - Spamming/sabotage leads to *retire* from call
> - Open mics while presentations can be *server muted*
> - Participants can use *different languages* for comfortably expressing ideas.

As I was saying before, it is really good that now gravity has a moderation powers, because that will help us to respect the protocol of the TEC meetings. It's very important that we have like clear rules so that anyone is lost, or that if anyone is new to the community, they can like get engaged where we behave the community. 

Because here we have to take in mind that this is our workplace, and there are certain boundaries on what can be published in the discord. Also there are certain boundaries of what can we do in a call because most of our calls are being recorded and streamed. It's very important that we keep order in our calls. 

We're to turn off any mic, if like the tone of the discussion is going too strong, or even if open mics are an open mic. It's good for the moderators to be able to server mute someone to looking for the quality of the call and quality of the sound. 

These are like the ground rules for the interactions that we have in polls. We have non-violent communication is the common rule and grateful to our members and to our co colleagues. That's why we give praise. It's good always to respect. 

We don't like using any like nicknames or something like that. We it's always good to ask someone, how do you like to be called. We promote humbleness of knowledge because here in these communities, we all are experts. We all are very competent people that has a lot of knowledge and a lot of wisdom in them. 

Instead of trying to impose our own perspective into the community, we want is to enrich the community with the diversity of knowledge that we all can bring.  

The idea is not to spend time in calls on topics that are not for the purpose of that call. If we want to discuss something, it's good to like schedule a other members work, we have to respect others and integrity. 

This is very aligned to what we are trying to say of valuing everyone and respecting the dignity of each member. These are also rules related to the community management in different platforms and like spamming and sabotage leads to retire from the call. 

If this is happening in a repetitive way, the user may be retired from the server. This is another thing that is encouraged is that as we are a community from, with people from all over the world, sometimes we can feel more comfortable expressing certain ideas in our native language. 

Even though that we communicate in English for like our main language to communicate, if there is a word or an expression that I don't know how to say in English, maybe I can use and talk in Spanish and other member can help me to express because the idea that even though that we have language barriers here, we can ease the communication for everyone.  

> ### Gravitons participation in Community management
> 
> The TEC has its own tailored rules and boundaries, which are co-created and translated into protocols, processes and guidelines that are made to follow our values, take care of our system and regulate autonomously. 
> 
> We are proposing a mutual-monitoring system, where each one of us can inform any issue (through the Gravity Typeform) to a designated group of members in the community, that will assume the following responsibilities:
> 
> a) As individuals, to promote dialogue within the organization and manage conflicts addressed through ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution),\
> b) As a collective, to take decisions on the implementation of graduated sanctions.\
> c) As both a collective and individuals, to commit to the practice of preventing, contextualizing and resolving disputes by regular attendance in our community practice.

Going deeper into gravity participation in community management, TEC has its own tailored rules and boundaries, which are co-created and translated into protocols, processes, and guidelines that are made to follow our values, take care of our systems and regulate autonomously. 

In gravity, we are proposing a mutual monitoring system with, or with a direct communication to the following responsibility as a need, as individuals to promote dialogue within the organization of sanctions and both a collective and individuals to in our community practice. 

> **Our goal: People in the community recognize the agreements and culturally act coherently with the values of the organization. If there is conflict, there are clear steps to follow in order to manage the situation for the effective search and implementation of solutions that respect the dignity of all parts involved.**
> 
> ### The Gravity group will aim to support the TEC by:
> 
> 1. Actively promoting trust, setting expectations, and managing conflict between individuals, the different groups, and the community as a whole.
> 2. Recognize boundaries and Areas Of Potential Dispute, as well as explicit violations of boundaries between individuals, groups, and the community as a whole.
> 3. Supporting communication between community members and encouraging participation at all levels. Individually, in groups and inside the community as a whole.
> 4. Hold admin powers to manage systems of communication (Discord, Telegram, Forum, CV App) on behalf of the individual, the constituent groups and the community as a whole.
> 5. Promote community resilience and long-lasting human relationships by proactively co-creating boundaries, discussion and exchange in a system of shared values.
> 6. As a group, take decisions regarding the implementation of graduated sanctions and commit to its participation with respect to all individuals, specially the ones that don’t follow to our terms and conditions.

What is our goal? The goal of gravity is that people in the community recognize the agreements and culturally act coherently with the values of the organization. If there is conflict, there are clear steps to follow in order to manage the situation for defected search and implementation of solutions that respect the dignity of all parts involved.  

It's very important to understand that this is something that are able to offer ways to solve some of the challenges brought up by the activities that we are involved in, like coordination activities, decision making activities, it's very important that we have clear steps to follow up, to manage the situations that may arise.

Conflict, as we have seen in past sessions is a natural possibility in life. 

We should be able to understand the possible conflicts that may arise within the activities that we are involved in and within the media that we communicate through. 

Then we can suggest actions for improving or for correcting that unwanted behavior. 

The gravity group aims to work the group aims to support the TEC by actively promoting trust setting expectations and managing conflict between individuals, the different groups and the community as a whole recognize boundaries and areas of potential dispute as well as explicit violations of boundaries between individual and the community; supporting communication between community members and encouraging participation at all levels individually in groups and inside the community as a whole; hold admin powers to manage systems of communication on behalf of the co groups and proactively promote boundaries discussions and exchange, and as a group take decisions regarding the implementation of, and commit to its participation with respect to all individuals, especially ones that don't follow and understand. 

Yeah, the idea instead of that, is that contract that don't follow our conditions can be correct it in order to prepare the harm done and think the same way that we do with respect and with value of their dignity. we, it would be on coherence that we would make that what idea, what we are doing is to  

(00:29:58)

Session that she said about how rules can be also for forgiving. Rules that we are trying to apply within the organization are not like punishing rules. 

In the next session I want to go like really in the detail of what our suggested graduate sanctions, but most of them are not any punishment. Most of them involve love, swarming with love, that is a sanction instead of having to pay a due or something a sanction can be a reasonable action to manage that conflict can be trying to engage him or her in other activities that may make her, or him feel more valued. Sanctions that we are proposing are very, like from the point of view of reconciliation and healing.  

> ### Guideline for scale of conflicts and graduated sanctions
> 
> #### Framework for studying conflicts and suggest appropriate actions to correct unwanted behavior.
> * **Small scale conflicts**: The issue involves few people
> * **Mid scale conflicts**: The issue is private but is latent in the community
> * **Big scale conflicts**: The issue is public and manifest in the community
> 
> #### Suggested actions per management mechanism (graduated sanctions)
> ##### Self compositives:
> * **Negotiation**: The conflict manager (graviton) can act as a witness for an issue that is handled directly between parties.
> * **Mediation**: The Graviton acts as a facilitator for the conflict management process, helping to identify key points to reach an agreement, but not directly suggesting a solution.
> * **Conciliation**: The conflict manager (Graviton) proposes and helps to implement a suggested solution that should be taken into consideration for approval between parties.
> 
> ##### Heterocompositive:
> * **Arbitrage**: An external point of view is needed to address the issue
> 
> More info at: [Scale of conflicts - Graduated sanction Guideline](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/scale-of-conflicts-graduated-sanction-guideline/234) (TECommons Forum)

Here is the guide for studying the conflict, serves us to suggest appropriate actions, to correct the unwanted behavior and a list of ingredients to identify when a conflict is in a mid scale conflict, trying to propose certain actions for each scale of sanctions guideline. 

You can see that the actions are like follow up. Most of the time nothing happens can be settled with, and this is like a signature that I am to make. Is that after every dispute, we can make a small reconciliation between the parts where both of them can like forgive themselves and forgive the other.

Say: "I'm sorry." Say: "thank you," for all the learnings that come from the conflict. "I love you." Love is recognize the other person as an equal and recognize the person values. 

Here we love set circles. Maybe if a member is feeling that he or she is being like pointed out or judged, maybe we can instead of making him or her like, feel more judge, we can start like swarming the conflict with good intentions. 

With people that help to heal, also we can as assign a graviton to gather information for involved parts, and we can have a private conversation between parts.  

The idea of these graduated sanctions is not to impose like sanctions and to punish people. But instead of that, the idea is that according to the issue, we can have a strategic responses to promote healing and wellbeing for the community and for the members. 

Also, we are promoting confidentiality, because I think that is a very key important part of the success of any mediation process. 

Yes, by framing the conflict be between small meetings and big scale conflict, we can also suggest these mechanisms that are the alternative dispute resolution mechanisms that we are going to offer as an organization.

As a group, we can offer negotiation. We can offer negotiation. That is just for an issue that is handled directly between parts. We can have a mediation that is that the Graviton facilitator for the conflict. 

it's the self composite alternative dispute solution that we can offer is like finishes when we have to look for training organization to address the issue. 

This is something that I want to explain better with this, with this graph. 

## Conflict Managment for the TEC (Draft)

![](https://i.imgur.com/vXdvm2U.png)

The idea that we can have an internal management layer that offers self-compositive alternative dispute solution. That the conflicts that arise within our organization can be settled within, within our internal layer and that they don't go into the exterior management. 

If a conflict is really big, then it's strategically good to request for an external management player and to go to a hetero compositive arbitrage or litigation. 

Our idea is to try to avoid arbitrage and arbitration and try to avoid including external actors to solve our, our own issues and try to solve our own issues internally first and only request if it is actually fit for the, for the better management of the problem. 

What I am trying to express in this, in this process tries to be like this internal management layer tries to provide this internal management layer. 

If we didn't have gravity, maybe a conflict can go to the outside, but the idea is that we can have a previous process where, where if the thing is small, we can handle it. Respond fast within the organization, and only request for arbitration and mitigation if we don't have the tools to manage that conflict internally. 

The idea is that when a conflict happens, it, goes through our internal management and we have our internal follow up, and we have our observation of the conflict, and we make our own insights and we make our own agreement. 

If they don't work, we go to we to review our graduated sanctions and our framework for analyzing and for identifying the conflict so that they can better respond to the conflicts that may arise in the organization.  

### Do you have any question until this moment?  

(00:39:46)
**Speaker 3**:    No, I would just say rather than strictly non-hierarchical, it might be said that it would be a better way to say it, to be that it's hierarchical in the sense that developmental levels of everyone and all of the levels engagement that exists within all of that. So, so to say that there's no hierarchy at all is not exactly true, but it's more of an radically inclusive version of that.  

(00:40:29)
**Juan Carlos**:    Okay. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Also the protocol, I think that can be updated and reviewed. So, I think it's also a valid and very good point that you're making during. 

If anyone has I prepared a meditation for today, I think it's very good and a good practice that we have, like been making in this graviton training that we have a moment to like, and having a lot of concerns, a lot of work, but it's also good to return, to go to the balcony and to keep our account mind so that we can pay better or other situations that may arise. 

### Meditation

![](https://i.imgur.com/xR2iyVg.png)

It's a good experience for all of us. If you want, you can close your, your camera and we will go to through the meditation.  

Take a comfortable position wherever you are at. You can be in your seat, or if you want to stand, you can do it as well. You can close your eyes or you can do it with your eyes open. Have some deep breaths, now gain conscious of where you are at, where you are at in your house, where you're at in your city, where you're at in your country and where you're at in the world and the boundaries of your body.  

You can touch your hands and you can touch your knees and touch your, your legs and get in touch with yourself. Try to see yourself and ask yourself, who are you? And what are the feelings that you have had this week? 

What has been the most predominant thoughts that you have had in this week, or in this day, and try to recognize if those feelings and those thoughts have made you happy. If you feel proud of feeling those feelings, and if you don't feel proud for feeling your feelings, also ask yourself why and what can you do to be more comfortable with your own thoughts and with your own feelings.  

Try to get a little bit inside of you and connect and understand what has been like the ideas that have been guiding your thoughts and your minds and your feelings now that you are deeply connected with yourself, and that you are deeply connected with your feelings without moving. 

If you had a camera in your imagination, take three steps back from yourselves, from yourself. Now you are not seeing the world from your point of view, rather than that, you are seeing yourself as a third person. 

When you see yourself what do you feel when you times we see others as third persons as separated from ourselves. 

When we see others, sometimes we think of an advice or a word that we want to say to others, but now think on an advice that you would like to tell yourself, a word that you would like to tell yourself as if you were seeing yourself as other person, because it's always very easy to advise others and to, yeah. 

Like we always have a good word for others, but sometimes we don't have good words for ourself. 

Give yourself a good advice and like, yeah, it is like, what would you say to yourself and how do you see the feelings that you feel and that move you as to yourself outside from you? 

Would you give yourself a problem on the back and say, good job, man, you're doing amazing? or, or would you say to yourself, okay, you can do better. Give yourself an advice, but try that advice comes with love. Don't try to judge yourself or say anything bad to yourself, just give yourself an advice keep doing what you're doing. 

Put more love on what you're doing, or yes. or like control your emotions, or like, be more wise with the, with the words you said, you can keep you the advice you gave to yourself. That is a gift that you made to yourself today. When you feel comfortable, you can tell me something to end this meditation.  

I want to share with you the experience that I had with this meditation. It's, it's very funny because I'm moving to a new apartment. When I got into the apartment, like some things were like falling apart and like things weren't as I wanted them to be. 

I was feeling anxious because I was feeling like, Hey, did I did good in moving? Or what was it, what I wanted? And I was very anxious. My brother told me this, told me, try to see yourself as if you were a third person. What would you say to yourself? And I mean, you are,  

You say to a person that is having the conflict that you are living right now. I did this and I said, I'm overreacting. Maybe I would tell myself or that, or the person that I see that is having this feeling that he's just being anxious and that he should like calm down and start seeing things from other point of view and like, not making a big of deal for something small and just like embrace that conflict will always arise.

There is always a pipe that is going to break and it's normal that like shit happens and anyone's life is perfect. we cannot expect like to move to a place and that everyone and that everything goes perfect from the first day, we have to give our energies and we have to, to be patient with ourselves as well. 

This is also very enlightening for this experience that we are having for moving to the new server, because it it's like that moving is always going to be the adaptation period

[...]

(00:54:28)
**Speaker 5**:    Then I just gave myself a hug and that was awesome. I think I needed a hug. It was nice to kind of be there for myself. Yeah, that's all, but I really enjoyed that meditation. That was a great exercise. Thank you.  

(00:54:45)
**Juan Carlos**:    Thanks, Sean. Yeah. It's, it's amazing.  

(00:54:50)
**Speaker 6**:    Yeah. I can also share something. That was a very great meditation for me. What came up was how seeing myself from outside made me talk in a more gentle way with myself, because I think I never talk to other people in the way I talk to me and then seeing this distance is like, wow, why do I talk to myself? So unfriendly sometimes when I always try to be friendly with others. It was really cool to have this perspective. Thanks one.
