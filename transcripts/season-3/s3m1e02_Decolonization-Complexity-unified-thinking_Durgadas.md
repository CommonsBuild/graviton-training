**Gravity Season 3 Module 1 Session 02**

## Introduction

![](https://i.imgur.com/Vxt3oAl.png)

(03:20)    
**Durgadas**:    Thank you guys all for coming. This is the fourth time I've presented this to the Gravity group. I'm Regis Chapman, Durgadas. I run a yoga studio. You guys actually see me in my yoga studio, most of the time it looks like this. Let's see. Who am I? I'm basically all of these things, a bit of a autistic polymath and my partner is Olympic medalist, PanAm games, medalist, and Commonwealth games medalist. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/4HHpTAY.png)

We had talked about Gravity DAO as the beginning about being a shelling point for the solution that people choose in the absence of communication. How do we treat each other when we don't have people to guide us and other things submit some more folks.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/tX70C8P.png)

As such, we basically have a aim to generate in our members and partner organizations, proactive antifragile, organizational culture, with robust sense, making shared mental models and language systems human-centric and ethical technology and services that bring together everyone, even in the absence of communication. 

This is also very nicely harmonized with the mission for the token engineering commons. Right now we're basically in phase one of splitting from token engineering commons in a practical sense, if not really in the philosophical sense. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/tX70C8P.png)

This, I originally did this because it was the first, this was the first training, but the whole idea here is that, there's some psychological that exist inside of organizations and within ourselves. 

Our work is really to go in and try to help people handle some of those things and to, and so today I'm gonna be talking about the depth and complexity aspects of how all of these things work and the big picture concepts and ideas that we can use to, and find action modes and things that we can operate from that can help us to build trust and resolve conflicts.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/uqZOI9d.png)

(06:35)    
**Durgadas**:    The basic skills of a Graviton are these fundamental things where we have to be able to be compassionate about what people are experiencing and gonna admit some more folks and mindful of about the complexity of the situation, try to have a situational awareness about what's going on to try to think in these broad-minded ways so that we can lead with our compassion and mindfulness. 

We want to do this in a way that it can create connections and allow for the humanity and what is arguably often a very busy situation in fraught with a lot of stress. 

### Gravity Style Interactions
The primary thing is to be able to be able to hold space. I've created a graphic that actually talks about the nature of how one is to go about holding space.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/g0sfWLe.png)

(07:59)    
**Durgadas**:    Basically there are three things about participating. There's the curated material. If you're gonna, for example, attend a training like this one, there's a bunch of curated material like this graphic and other things, concepts and other things that have already been created. 

We, as Graviton, when we pop into other communities, they already have a cultural dynamic. They have certain ways to go about doing things, and it's our job to step in there and figure out how to moderate between the discussions, which have in the cross pollination side of the thing may have stopped being generative and become otherwise unhealthy. Then also to work with the existing culture as it is. This is a model that can work at multiple levels.  

If you're participating in a group, that's got a bounded systems thinking, gotta get things done, mode. You can work in that participation model across the top. That handles how to participate with informed consent and deal with expectations and safety allow for people to talk about what's alive in them and to discover things, and then on the backside of that to make sense of it. 

Then create or modify whatever processes might exist or need to change. What you can see is that you would basically go around this model over and over again until hopefully what you would end up in would be a more complexity thinking set of processes. 

That is a lot of what we're trying to do here in Gravity is to allow people to go through a process where the, we often talk about how we're conflict management group, but at the same time, we have to be more broad minded because if we're going to actually resolve conflicts, we have to be able to transform them.  

### Two ways of Thinking : Divided vs Unified

(10:16)    
**Durgadas**:    That automatically would take whatever curated system that existed and transform it into something which is automatically more complex, more inclusive and more, hopefully better for people. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/4qKmHzl.png)

The basis for what I talk about is often dealing with the neuroanatomy of the brain, the left and right brain. There are just two basic ways of thinking. When they combine together, the whole idea is to work in this paradoxical way. We can come up with the third alternative that might exist between what it seems to be to apparent opposite. 

You'll see that this thing is actually, this thing that I'm talking about is repeated over and over in this process. When I'm talking about decolonization part of the thing is to recognize that colonization takes place fundamentally in the divided thinking brain. 

The extractive exploitive monetary system that we're all participating in outside of the world of cryptocurrencies is all because our culture validates teaches and acts like the only thing that exists is this divided way of thinking, which has inevitable effects in terms of people.  

We'll say that this thing has more or less value. This person has more or less value. This theory is more or less value things like this. The idea being that the point of my work is to try to get people to include the unified thinking more, which is the right brain and to the ideal way that we can talk about these processes by using paradoxes. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/XQxeQ4M.png)

With that in mind, I basically, I would, I'm gonna upload this to a Google thing after the meeting. I would suggest that you click on these links and watch these two videos. 

* [The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbUHxC4wiWk)
  
One is jewel Jill Bolte Taylor's, very inspirational [My stroke of insight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyyjU8fzEYU), where she had a hematoma that exploded in her brain. She had to watch her own brain devolve. It's cool in a way, because she was a brain scientist.  

She got to see it from the inside and then see how her bright brain took over and how she could experience the unified nature of reality. This is also true in the years that I spent living in Hindu monastery. 

A lot of the spiritual stuff that you go through and study is really about validating the right hemisphere of the brain. That has implications for how we behave in society. You can actually see how these things roll up. 

I have a much larger presentation that includes all of this stuff that I talk about. That's really specific to decolonization, but it usually takes two or three hour period to explain all of it. I'm not gonna get into the whole thing. I'm just gonna stay with the key points here. 

If you can just understand that there are two fundamental ways to think, and one is divided and the other is unified. In order to decolonize ourselves, we have to understand the various reflexive divided ways of thinking we've been brought up with in our education system and otherwise, and the ethical systems that we need to create considering the unified side of the picture. 

### Divided vs Unified: Social Forms
![](https://i.imgur.com/L9x24rC.png)

One of the most inspiring things, when I left the ashram living for the, for where I lived for many years, I saw this video and realized that's what I was doing all this time. It was a very nice way to contextualize some of this work that I had been doing internally.  

When I came to the Token Engineering Commons, I saw that actually what we were doing is we were doing this thing called the cultural build. I realized that the internal relationships that we were having around our own divided brains had been very much revealed in terms of the, I'm gonna admit some more folks, very much revealed in the way that our social forms are happening. 

Sexism, racism, transphobia, all these things all come from this divided way of looking at things. In the end, if you think only in divided ways, you're gonna always end up in this colonizer worldview. You're gonna end up in this divided way of thinking. You're gonna end up in a narcissistic approach because all you're doing is reflexively dividing all the time. 

It should be pretty obvious by looking at the culture that we're doing that all the time. All the pretexts for this narcisistic abuse are just relatively simplistic. The point of all of this is to understand how that's tricked us in the financial system. 

The way we treat each other, the way we educate each other, the way we socialize, where we talk to each other, and the financial systems and instruments that we've created on the back of this divided way of thinking all are revealed inside of the inside of the culture, that basically just makes even unified things into divided things.  

Here's a lists of things that I've observed about the nature of these different social forms. Prior to colonization, you could have the whole entire world was in a more or less unified way of thinking as a whole. 

You could have somebody like a Gengus Khan or somebody come along and do very divided colonizer approach to things, but their actions would be reabsorbed back into the overlying unified mentality that existed on the planet at the time. 

Since colonization by Europe and others basically that is now a worldwide phenomenon. The thermostatic balance that used to be able to happen with a generally unified approach to things, please do meet yourself by the way whoever's talking there.  

It used to be that we could contextualize ourselves in this unified way, but now we have an entire planet that's covered in divided colonizer world views. We almost have to rebalancing so that the unified mindset can come back. 

It's in my view, the whole reason why cryptocurrencies exist is to try to redress that balance. If we don't do that internally with ourselves, then we can't really see the root causes of all of these issues. 

My work recently has been very much working along this subversive line and trying to diagnose this without having to say some of the things that you hear often, and in the existing culture, everybody is suffering under this social form., but some of us have certain amount of blindness to it that we're not aware of.  

### Divided vs Unified: Monetary Systems
![](https://i.imgur.com/N99Qhgx.png)

(19:05)    
**Durgadas**:    My reason for participating in Token Engineering Commons is to try to help individual people to understand or recognize what's going on. Then that'll make them more able to create financial instruments and deal with each other in such a way that we can undo the legacy of that colonization. 

Like I said before, we still have two monetary systems and there's an extract exploitative versus the aligned and generative side of the picture. Of course from dealing with the DAO side of things, that there are regenerative, eco villages and things that are all coming up, all of these are response to that type of setup as well. 

What I was looking for was just a unifying framework in which to understand how all of these things works and there's a certain amount of inherent complexity to it. 

### GravityDAO Components

(20:04)
**Durgadas**:    The next slide is about working with four basic principles that are set up in two halves. One is the trust creation side. The other is the conflict management side. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/bLH6uiw.png)

My emphasis is really on, I don't know very much about principal D at all, but principal, a principal B and principal C are my jam. There's a bunch of stuff in here. For example, there's still more people to admit.  

I'm basically here talking to you today and right now about the complexity and how we go through and develop things, and what are the different kinds of mental models that we can use. Then I'll talk a bit about OS from principles and how the commons binds all these things together. 

Each principle is a modality of creating a shared language of sense, making, understanding, and connection. That's super important because I find that a lot of people who work in this space, they're all spend a lot of time learning solidity or Python or any number of programming languages. 

Yet we don't spend hardly any time talking about how is that we get along and what are the shared languages of that we can use to actually get along. What are the different ways in which we can connect and understand what we're doing in this unified framework.  

### Unified Vision
![](https://i.imgur.com/ioCnlWj.png)

Seems to me that as a Graviton, you need to have a unified vision. You need to be able to look at these four principles tools that you can use to unify our thinking and being Graviton. It's actually, our primary role is to hold that unified space when other people cannot. 

Even yourself, sometimes you'll find yourself being unable to hold that space. You might need Graviton or a friend to come in here. Your confidence of this thing can be educated and expanded in internally. This training is an attempt to do that. It's a lifelong pro generative process that really you need to work with and understand that it's an evolutionary process of where we're continuously curating new things and new methodologies for connecting with each other new mental models and other things.  

(22:50)    
We can improve our ability to curate, to moderate and to cross pollinate. Then what that does, that it will give you the ability to see into the unified and divided viewpoints of people who are often broken up by a conflict, or just the inability, because our society doesn't train us to really think in any unified ways to learn how to do that. In the first principal, a basically a round of trust creation. 

### Complex Developmental Thinking
![](https://i.imgur.com/5WlG6xm.png)

I'm really a fan of these three basic things. One is the connection framework, which I won't go into here, but we can talk about in another context, spiral dynamics and integral theory, which essentially are theories of everything that give you a sense of how people can develop their own internal work. 

Then deliberately developmental organizations and me inside of a meta modern system, which token engineering comments and other DAOs are attempting to become, but you're not really meta modern, unless you're trying to care for all of the individual participants in the system and not just fiscally either. 

### Ostroms Principles
![](https://i.imgur.com/rK024ZM.png)

The overall psychological health of the participants in that system principle B is about Ostrom's principles.  

This is a very beautiful graphic that I found today that actually talks about this. The Gravity group is focused on about half of these things specifically. 4, 5, 6, and eight. The point of four, five, and six should be obvious to people who are participating in an individual DAO and then the responsibility for governing the common nested tiers. 

That would mean our relationships with other DAOs would be affected. It's also just a basic psychological truth that you can't extend to someone else that, which you have not extended to yourself. If you're not compassionate to yourself, it's not likely you're gonna be compassionate to others. 

If you don't care for all the individual participants in your group, then when you reach out to other DAO and that relationship's gonna be more fraud.  

Part of the idea behind Gravity is to not only improve all the individual participants, but as a side effect, you would end up having an excellent way of dealing with things on the DAO side of the picture and when you're interacting and having partnerships and such. 

That's implied by the fact that the common stack started the TEC and the TEC started Gravity and omega and all these other groups that work independently. There's a bit of an evolution that I've noticed here. 

### Are you a Cryptoeconomics DAO
![](https://i.imgur.com/ChQg4gA.png)

Gravity and the Gravity DAO, and just recognizing that there is a step two to this. What I've noticed is that a lot of people are tired of this abusive extractor system and jump into a DAO. What they don't really realize is that they need to work on how to deprogram and decolonize from the abusive extractive system and take back agency and autonomy. 

We've been trained away from knowing how to retain our own agency and autonomy and how to take responsibility. It's complex, you need a lot of trauma informed, compassionate groups and teams and people who have language around those things. Gravity and Graviton are all about trying to get those things worked on and make the participants in the system better at all of that. 

That the TEC they can actually fulfill the promise of the DAO, which is really a digital version of an intentional community from that has happened for a long time. I often say that step number two is shadow side of the psychological shadow side of DAOs right, where you don't just get to skip over all that other work.  

I do notice that even in the token engineering commons, it took an entire year to do a cultural build. There are still parts of that we missed so we have to think about that as a continuous improvement process rather than an individual thing. Probably participating in Gravity by becoming a Graviton, then you'll become a lot more informed about how to deal with all of these things. 

Then you can better represent and frankly become a DAO. I've taken it further in the sense that I believe that there's, once you are actually a DAO that gives you a different ground floor in which a place of strength in which to come. 

### From DAO to DDO
![](https://i.imgur.com/i644Zcp.png)

Then what do you do? You have a stable decentralized structure from which then individuals can grow and become the best versions of themselves in step four here where a deliberately developmental organization would help in and assist with that.  

(28:47)    
Instead of just caring about its own self and not caring about the individuals participating in the system, this is a view of the AQAL and spiral dynamics theory of everything. 

### All Quadrants All Levels
![](https://i.imgur.com/9rULmC8.png)

This is the all quadrants, all levels model, and it may seem a bit confusing, but there is a very simple narrative framework that you can use to understand this. If you find yourself in the individual interior, that's where you generally are going to operate from. 

Your general self and consciousness is going to have a certain developmental level. You're going to be in the achiever self or the sensitive self side of the thing, because that's generally where most of society is now. You'll be trained up like that. 

If you interact with a group like the token engineering comments, which is really green here and maybe bordering on the integral, then there may be, if you're coming from an egocentric self and try to interact with a pluralistic group over here, there could be a conflict in terms of the way that you imagine the culture working.  

These kinds of tools give us some way of grasping the larger forces at work when it comes to dealing with conflicts. If you've got a whole bunch of people who are working out the egocentric self a lot of these, what do you wanna call 'em? 

Shit coin groups or whatever who are just trying to take advantage of people that's a, that's a recipe for conflict. People think they're coming into a pluralistic thing when in fact the cultural worldview of whatever group for those kinds of coins is really like a very different thing. 

Then there's a system that's created by that culture and worldview. What I've noticed, there's a pendulum that goes between the individual self and the consciousness and the social system and environment that is the result of the culture of worldview.  

The individual participants influence the culture and worldview, which then influences the system. Then that system then works backward and influences the cultural and worldview and the individuals participating in the system. 

It's important to be able to get how that works and to have in your mind that you can evaluate yourself and work with other people who might be developed out here in tier two to understand how to develop yourself and then how to develop the culture and worldview of the groups that you're participating in. 

As Graviton times, we're often called in specifically and hired specifically to accomplish goals like that. That's why we're talking about it here.  

### Polarity Maps
![](https://i.imgur.com/82YvwUK.png)

(32:03)    
**Durgadas**:    Then we can use other tools, and this is just one of many, but I wanted to give you an example of a worksheet. If you were, if you're paying a decent amount of attention, you might have noticed that way back here. 

I have included the polarity mapping infinity symbol behind because it actually relates directly. If you take a look at the way, you can actually just sit down with a group and try to take a look at this. 

This is basically a worksheet that you could use to figure out the ways in which conflicts can occur, because oftentimes it's a conflict between two false dualities people who were afraid of change. People who are feel like they're stuck in an overly stable system, and there can grow conflict between that. 

### Gravity DAO: What we're working on

In Gravity, what we do is we develop and work within and inventory and create mental models and processes and educate people on methodologies to resolve different kinds of conflicts. This is just one of those, and you can see that this is highly correlated to the left right. Brain stuff that I'm talking about too.  

Right now is we're one of the finalists in the commons prize currently in phase one of Gravity DAO, which is pulling us out of token engineering commons. We have our website, which is in a coming soon mode right now. 

I've got links to all of the processes. If you wanna participate in helping us deal with the website, or do they need planning, or, and then Bianca's got psychology working group. These are some of the other things that we're doing. 

The narrative things that I'm talking about, I'll be offering a group course between the Omega group and Gravity, that talks about how to look at a particular thing, a website, a graphics the ones that I create about doing narrative construction, because often narratives are the way in which people will thanks. 

If you have two posing, conflictual narratives learning how to understand each side of that, break that up, and then find a way to weave those narratives back together is very useful skill for a Graviton. 

### Questions 

**Durgadas**:    I'm happy to answer any and all questions at this point.  

#### How Divided vs Unified thinking can make an impact on how you face a situation?

(35:19)    
**Juan Carlos**:    You've gone really deep into a lot of complex concepts, but it all can be explained really easily. We can make some like memes or metaphors to, explain what we are talking about divided and unified and yeah. How can this change of approach make an impact on how you face a situation?  

(35:59)    
**Durgadas**:    There are three things about the way this works. There's your own internal things. Like for example, I have autism just have to deal with my own brain. Right. Then there's what society is trying to tell me about the fact that I have autism. I have to then be able to figure out, is that me, or is that society, or is that my parents?

When we're dealing with conflicts it's important to be able to parse out all those things and to have tools to break that up so that you can understand the underlying narratives and hidden things which exist there. 

I have gone really deep into a series of complex things, the point about all of this is that I find that the colonized approach is one of de-contextualization where we've removed our ability to think with complexity or think broadly.  

What I'm attempting to do is to give you guys a series of mental models and other things into which you can contextualize your work with the Gravity DAO and with figuring out how to resolve conflicts as you participate in those things.  

(37:26)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I remember you have this beautiful example. If you accidentally, you are walking and you bump your finger to the bed. You don't yell at your finger. That your finger is part of yourself.  

(37:45)    
**Durgadas**:    That's right. That's a unified way of thinking.  

(37:50)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Why do we yell and judge others exactly. When we are like all part of a united society. I loved that example.  

(38:06)    
**Durgadas**:    And what I'm saying is just that it's been my observation, that a persistent decontextualization where when I go to scratch my head, I'll accidentally poke myself in the eye and I'm just there yelling at my finger. 

That seems to be the way our culture works now. What I'm saying is the dumbest thing in the world to me. I want a solution for that. How can I think about this so that when I accidentally do poke myself in the eye and go, no. It's okay.

It's true what Sean is saying this stuff is only complex because people have made it complex. I like to think that we can all figure out how to do this stuff.

#### Is this understanding complementary with technology and how does it scale in tech?

(39:11)    
**Sarah**:    Yes. Thanks first. Thank you for this great presentation, which are summarizes all this practices to build a healthy community. What I wanted to ask you is what do you think that the technology or the DAO adds to it, and how do you think this can survive in some way, large scale in technology? Because we are talking on one part of practices of an intention behind these practices and then comes the tokens and all the technology stuff, and also the large scale in term of number of people. I'd be very interested about your views of this release. Does the DAO layer technology layer, additional tweet.  

(40:07)    
**Durgadas**:    There are three basic examples that I like to give that's related to this. Okay. Think about a figure like Jonas Sock. He discovered a vaccine for a debilitating disease and then gave it away to the world. 

John Dobson, he was a Vedantic monk and lived in a Hindu monastery for 30 years. He was one of my mentors. He actually invented the Dobsonian telescope and gave away that. He used to have a thing called the Sidewalk Astronomers he'd point and people come look at Saturn. I had no idea you could build something from home Depot that could see Saturn. 

You've got this egalitarian mindset. That's thinking about the commons thinking about. That's what I was saying about Gravity being so rooted in Ostrom's principles and the groundedness of the commons. What's happened with us is the colonizers mindset. 

Where I live in British Columbia, you've got what's called crown land, technically owned by the queen of England. The queen goes in and cut down all the old growth trees. That's the way we tend to treat the commons, we treat water this way.  

We treat native people this way. We treat every, so this is what we do with the commons. This is an extractive process. What if we were to value the commons instead like a Jonas Sock? 

One of my favorite things is Hinduism is a decentralized religion. I don't know if you're aware of this. The Indian continent was invaded for like a thousand years, consecutively, never ending. There's just so many people just constantly invading it. 

The response that the Hindus had was that they took all of the religion away from the temples and away from the churches. Now every Hindu has got a locker room in their house where they worship and that's how it works for them. Right. That's a decentralized really, it's a billion people. 

Omega group is about trying to create people who would use their intelligence like Jonas Sock and John Dobson. For people who work in token engineering, we want to encourage them and undo the damage that's been done by the extractive abusive system and support them coming to these other ways of thinking.  

As a population, then we can be wise enough to make a decentralized choice like Hindus decentralizing their worship, we can do, we can do that with finance too. Abusive systems, in order to replace them, you have to create parallel systems. 

It's important that you have people who like Jonas stock and John Dobson who were creating these parallel systems that don't just recreate another problematic system. That's gonna blow up in the faces of people three or four generations down the line. 

Did I answer your question?  

(44:21)    
**Sarah**:     I completely agree on all your points on what goes wrong. My question was really focus on the the link with technology, because I had been, I had been discussing, for example, let's say that after a certain number of people, it gets really hard to maintain compassion, empathy, trust. For me, it's a key question and also how do you tokenize taking care of how do you separate taking care of her from being inefficient? And then doesn't, it takes away the spirit of it. How do we deal with that?  

The extractive abuse of mindset is the mindset of a merchant it's just straight up. One thing one person has this amount of value and all objects are evaluated according to value. 

Even look at how our mentality is about our psychology do I have worth, do I have value? Do what I'm saying? And, what is it that I do value?, it's just subversively true that we have learned to treat ourselves in this way. 

What I'm suggesting is that technology itself, isn't the problem, but technology has typically been used to aggregate wealth for the already wealthy. That's just typically how it works.  

Up to now basically merchants run the world. Now nation states are just figureheads and it's the merchants that decide everything. The mentality of having this thing is worth more or less because of some arbitrary system, you can undo that problem with technology. 

An example of decontextualization is putting all value into a token. How about we take the old Hindu idea about the eight forms of wealth, and instead of a single token we actually talk about the circle of genius and social wealth and all these different kinds of things that add to our sense of wealth. 

That's what colonizers do. "There can be only one." My point is that we often do this. I spend a lot of time saying, can we make this broader? Right. I've got a graphic for that let me just find it real quick so I can talk about what you're asking. Here it is.

[The Invisible Economy: Incentive Framework](https://powerdada.medium.com/the-invisible-economy-incentive-framework-1c414ed5c5b7)

This is the graphic I made with DADA. My influence was to add the eight forms of wealth around the outside. If you're talking about smashing everything down into a single token. That's a mistake because then we're not recognizing the humanity, which is inherent in these different kinds of ways that we're doing things. 

Technology is created, but you have to have, we have to have, we have to actively create people who are thinking about the commons before themselves. We can then take that technology and leverage it for the use of the commons rather than against. What I'm suggesting is this left and right brain way of thinking is all about shifting the balance.  
    
We've been educated in a weird way that makes it Jonathan hate calls it, the weird Western Europe, educated industrialized, rich democratic nations. The amount of influence that goes into the, our brain wiring. 

For weird versus non weird societies, let's say indigenous peoples versus these colonized societies that even goes to visual processing. If you draw like a line on a piece of paper for a weird mentality, they're gonna see the square and the line as two separate entities, whereas non weird or native population would regard those two things in relationship with each other. 

It is so deeply held. I feel like we need to recognize the problem and then work within these new communities to educate our way out of that issue that we're facing. Hopefully that answered your question in terms of technology. 

(50:12)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I just want to share an idea that Ben one once wrote and that the change we want to do in DAO is because DAO will be new institutions. If we don't intentionally change the way or the personas we want to have in participating in this environment, if we don't work on those people, we will end up having like destructive DAOs. 

If we work on that infrastructure of the new institutions, then we will have a high impact on the future because those new institutions will build the future. If we work on that ethic for these new institutions, we'll have a direct impact on the future. Yeah, I will pass it to Sean too.  

(51:22)    
**Speaker 5**:    Yeah. I'll just so much information here and it's, and it's all so extremely valuable. I really wish that this could be two sessions because this is just absolutely fascinating for me. My major takeaway from this is, and something that really resonates with me is something you said that you can't show someone compassion if you don't show that for yourself. 

That can go up towards the organizations too. Right? If organizations are formed in a way, and they're not like owning these thought processes in this way of doing things, then it resonates in their actions. That through like this training specifically, if we can find that place in ourselves and come to these conflicts from that place, we're also opening up these people that are having conflicts to this way of thinking. 

That's so important. Not just for DAO, as I'm saying for the evolution of humanity this is right, this is huge. It's something like if you can just be open minded and really like take this in and own it's really huge. I just, I really wanna thank you for sharing this with us Regis.

(52:51)    
**Durgadas**:    I keep this thing as a reminder, it was one of the, one of the spiritual teachers that my partner loves. This is in like a little calendar thing. That's got some reminders and the teacher of this current teacher that we're used to say, who are you to set right. The world, you have to first rectify yourself and your own mind. When the mind becomes right, then everything will appear, all right. Look within yourself. Then if you're going to act on the basis of that, then you can act from a place of, am I the doer of this thing? Non doership is really big because you wanna, in many ways you wanna act on behalf of the universe. Right. If you still think that you are the unique contributor to this, or I donated so much money, or I did I created this token, that's gonna change the world. That's more of that same colonize mindset. Do what I mean? I got mine hustle, culture whatever. That's so thanks for recognizing that. Any, anybody else wanna point something outer or Mo or just, or Nicola David. Heather.  

(54:11)    
**Durgadas**:    Oh, Gimo okay. Gomo  

(54:15)    
**Speaker 6**:    Yes. Thank first. Congratulations for your very amazing that one of your charts, we can see the steps, how to convert to DAO. The really challenge is that we are going to have in the step two and three is because we have to be confident that the realistic thing is that the traditional way we are organized is by a few groups of power. Right. That's right. They are really interested in keep that power.  

(54:59)    
**Durgadas**:     

(55:00)    
**Speaker 6**:    The real challenge is how are we going to convince them or how they going to convince themselves that they need to change? This is a really change for yeah. For Rav and the organization.  

(55:16)    
**Durgadas**:    And it hearkens back to Ostrom's principles. If we're doing mutual monitoring, what are we monitoring for? Do what I'm saying?, for example, I would like somebody to say that somebody like Griff or Livy, or how effective are they at breaking up and distributing the power that they have because they're people who are there at the foundation of this thing, how effective are they at that I would reward them for giving away their power. Right. You can see that Griff is amazing at that. You can see that living's amazing at that. Right. It's the thing we don't measure, but why. Right., so I would wanna look at all these metrics. How effective have you been at deprogramming yourself from the abusive extractive economy? Do what I'm saying? How effective have you been at decolonizing yourself or taking up a unified perspective? Right. I would wanna have metrics on that stuff and not many of the other things that I see DAO actually putting metrics on. Yeah.  

(56:23)    
**Speaker 2**:    Thank you.  

(56:26)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Well, yeah. Continue.  

(56:30)    
**Durgadas**:    Those of you who need to go you're, you're welcome to go, but I'm gonna I say, I'm gonna, I'm gonna stay. You, I can answer all the rest of your questions until they're done. We're at the top of the hour and I wanna respect people's time, but I'm off today. I don't have any time constraints.  

(56:56)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I just want go ahead that next week we will have Morgan around trauma sensitive and anti-oppressive culture, but yeah, I will open the mic for Nicole and for AIA.  

(57:12)    
**Speaker 7**:    Thank you. Hello everybody. Can you hear, can you hear me well? Yep. Awesome. I just wanna, thank you. I know I see your name Regis Chapman, but I know they call you.  

(57:26)    
**Durgadas**:    ER, do.  

(57:28)    
**Speaker 7**:    Durga.  

(57:29)    
**Durgadas**:    This is Durga dos me servant.  

(57:33)    
**Speaker 7**:    Thank you. I really deeply appreciate your presentation today. I love the presentation. I'd love to get a link for it.  

(57:41)    
**Durgadas**:    Oh, sure.  

(57:42)    
**Speaker 7**:    I also, 

(57:44)    
**Speaker 7**:    I want to say, I want to say that everything you've shared deeply resonates and I am pretty freshly only three months through part of the GI team. I've been for last year high from Costa part of building intentional communities on the ground. We were successful enough to have one own association set up and founded. We are actually actively working on our micro economy. We are going to launch our own DAO. It's really beautiful to be part of this whole new evolution and growth and what it's coming with that in DAO and social across all these amazing tools while I do agree a hundred percent that the work starts within ourselves, because if we do not exemplify, if we do not adopt the principles that are just so deeply rooted in our culture and understand and be able to zoom out, we only will be hardly to. How can we really participate in this change and bring solutions to the conflict, which conflict is part of everyday life. Actually I've never grown more. My really my relationships were never strong if there were not the conflicts there that we were able to work through together, but it does take a lot of personal work, a lot of work with the ego and really taking, putting off the personal agenda and looking at the bigger picture on, in that, on this way, we can really aim, try to do bigger things.  

(59:35)    
**Durgadas**:    Yeah. It's interesting what I'm talking about, the left and the right, those things are not opposites. One includes the other, do you see what I'm saying? It's not that but the divided way of thinking sets up a false duality about everything, do what I'm saying? And then it is actually the ego is nothing but a construction of those mistakes. It is a, is it a thing you have to put in effort to maintain? Right. I'm yeah, here, I'm making, 

(00:09)    
**Speaker 7**:    How  

(00:10)    
**Durgadas**:    Can you, and then I'm gonna validate that fallacy over and over again. Then on top of that, I'm gonna build a whole nother group of house of cards and I'm gonna keep validating all of this stuff. Then I'm gonna call myself by this name and the value of having another name. I figured out was that you have to look at your identity. I went from being a king. Regs. It's good to be the king to being a servant. Right. It's very much like a paradoxical way of looking at that. It, I almost feel like it groups like yours should take on a different name for what role you're currently inhabiting in the DAO or whatever, in a sense. Right. Because then it would change your identification as to what's going on. I just sorry to add to that, but I wanted to just add that. I'm sorry to interrupt you  

(00:59)    
**Speaker 7**:    Agree? Yes. For sure. I had something to respond that it just went away, but  

(01:08)    
**Durgadas**:    Sorry about that.  

(01:09)    
**Speaker 7**:    This is a, this is a beautiful discussion. Yes. I agree, oh, it's came back. It's coming back. Oh, I didn't wanna say that. We that's the, there's the beauty of duality. We are living in a world of contrast, so how can we embrace it all and find a piece with it all. Cause I used to run away from conflict now it's my, I find so much passion in it. It's really just changing the perspectives and making new relationship with yourself and with all the narratives you have in your mind. Right.  

(01:38)    
**Durgadas**:    Well, and the other thing that happens with this culture is that it actually fo the cult, the divided culture fosters immaturity, because the, for my definition of maturity means your ability to resolve parent dualities. To transcend and include those two things in a common understanding that would make it so that both of those things are both valid, but also no longer just pulling you're being drawn in quartered. What I'm saying? It's just you have to, you have to pull yourself up and out of that and create a thing. That is the process itself of maturity of repeating that over and over again. I could be 70 years old and be a man baby. We see in public life all over the place now, but what I'm saying is the culture does that.  

(02:28)    
**Durgadas**:    And so we have the chance to create our own thought culture and to create our own make decisions that are in fact mature. That would systems that wouldn't enable us to transcend and include apparent dualities into a larger understanding and recontextualize our lives. A lot of what I do is I just flood people with context and then they're, oh my God, this is too much, but I do that for a reason because I feel like that has to maybe break the hold of the decontextualized colonized way of living.  

(03:07)    
**Speaker 7**:    Yeah, I see that you're bringing spirituality into practical world with words that are understandable for everyone, for practical mind, for the left Hemis spirit. Exactly. I love it. Thank you so much for, yeah.  

(03:22)    
**Durgadas**:    You're welcome.  

(03:23)    
**Speaker 7**:    Honored to be. Thank you so  

(03:24)    
**Durgadas**:    Much. Thank you. A wish just, and look forward to hearing you.  

(03:29)    
**Speaker 8**:    Mm. Hello? Hello. Thank you. I did not know that. I was the jerk unmuted. I was weeding and I didn't even know. I, I went to go move towards the end and I picked up my phone and I was, I like turned my camera off. I was just a gasp. I was, oh gosh, I'm so sorry. It's all good. It was sweet to be with nature, listening to you and experiencing the evolution of your presentations. That's a treat. Okay. To see the ways this has. I remember the presentations before I attended my first Graviton training. They were different before then evolved through then have changed now and are now like this and are still changing. It's just awesome to watch these graphics evolve cuz that's what happens over time.  

(04:24)    
**Speaker 8**:    And it's beautiful to visually see it. I also wanted to thank you for the ways that you're able to contextualize really heavy stuff. One thing that I've learned in a lot of the like trauma work that I've done is that it takes a lot of different approaches and modalities to break down. What's, what's been done to us by our environments. Products of our environments. There's gonna be so many different ways to reach so many people. There's gonna be like a need for so many people to speak to these things in so many different ways. I just have a lot of appreciation. I will cuz I'm autistic, I'll disassociate a bit before I'll get activated by you I'll have to be, oh shoot facing out. Hey. I'll like fidget or something and I'll be alright, but I don't get activated by you. I don't like wanna disassociate and be, oh my gosh, because of something you had, you keep it in a like this English, math place or something is what it feels like for me. I just, I wanna thank you for your magic. Thank you for this session.  

(05:32)    
**Durgadas**:    Thank you Walter. I can't yet hear you Walter  

(05:48)    
**Speaker 9**:    While Walter solves he's mic my muted. Sorry.  

(05:53)    
**Durgadas**:    Oh, there we go. Yeah, there you're  

(05:55)    
**Speaker 9**:    Okay. Technology is great. Right?  

(05:59)    
**Speaker 9**:    I'm still waiting for that paperless office. Yes. Nice meeting those amongst you. I haven't met yet and big hello to the few I have. I've been only like wanting to learn from this initiative for about six months. Now that I'm three sessions late, I'm still hopeful. What I wanted since my focus is pretty much, I'm put my spirituality thing on hold a couple of years ago, as far as the active work, kinda back to societal in. I'm kind, what I observed when I first got involved was DAO in the DAO stack and argon ecosystems about three years ago is that people kept proposing cause based political action based DAO and they never ever gone anything. They didn't even develop through the very initial stages. I was curious about that somehow what those folks were envisioning and what DAO structures at the time offered really was not a match. Lately there's been this kinda labeling of impact DAO, but I don't necessarily see those really happen either. I'm wondering from this community, what your thoughts are about the well, the wants and the outcomes.  

(07:49)    
**Durgadas**:    Well, it seems to me that let's use it, let's use a political example. Okay. If you look at the propaganda of the Western mentality. The Russia went through in the nineties that went through this whole glass nose period. Where things we had democracy showed up in Russia and everything. It's funny because with the advent of bladder and Putin and everything from our perspective, that was like 30 years of, geez, it must be nice to finally be Russia experiencing this thing. This is the narrative that you hear a lot, but the Russians, it was a nightmare because they've been, they were just locked into their whole way. Of doing everything was given to them, they had a good job. It was, it wasn't a good apartment.  

(08:48)    
**Durgadas**:    They had a car, they wasn't a good car, but they had something, what I'm saying? But then the moment democracy O opened up, then all the kleptocrats showed up and took everything and there was nothing less for any of them. Now you have to have another strong leader back in Vladimir Putin to put things right again. That's why that person has so it's interesting to see how the, if you look at it from the inside. The shadow part, they were not ready. They didn't have tools. This is what I'm talking about with my step two thing on the screen, you don't just jump over and just suddenly become a democracy in Russia. They have no competence at that. They have, they've lived for hundreds of years without that stuff.  

(09:33)    
**Durgadas**:    Do what I'm saying? There's just no way to just drop them into this because all you'll end up with is a bunch of people stealing money from 'em and all those people are now billionaires. They were common street thugs before, but now they're billionaires. It's just because they weren't given, they weren't given the tools and the mentality. What I'm saying is that's as true of DAOs is it, is anything else because we just didn't address the underlying structural and individual participatory systems that would evolve that to make it, so that democracy was then viable for Russia. I find this a lot in DAO, and even in a group that this forward thinking as token engineering commons, there's all this psychological shadow of the legacy cultural code base that comes with you.  

(10:24)    
**Durgadas**:    And you have to have a system that's prepared to handle all of those things. That's what I would say is probably if you could look at your other DAOs, I would say that there is a whole lot of agreement about the way in which you should go about this thing, because a lot of people go something's really wrong. Then they go, what it is, it's just one thing. Then let's solve that one problem. Then there's, the real problem is a thousand things, but you don't, you don't do the work to document those thousand things much less put in systems in place that would allow you to evolve and subvert and heal and deal with all of the, those other 999 things. Right?  

(11:11)    
**Durgadas**:    That's what I know what I find, and that's why decontextualized colonized systems work so well is because if you, if nobody knows anything about themselves or the systems on which any of this stuff is built look at the financial system. Now, the nightmare that is moving from the current financial system to cryptocurrency is really difficult because all of the security, all of the other stuff is all on you. There's just this massive learning curve that you're not interested in learning about. The metaphor I often use is if anyone's ever read Isaac AOVs the IBO series, the protagonist in that film or book series suddenly realizes that there is a problem with the robots. The thing that he has to do is to teach he's robots have existed for generations. He doesn't even know how to dress himself anymore because it's been done with the assistance of robots for his whole life.  

(12:08)    
**Durgadas**:    And so his way of rebelling against the system is to teach himself how to dress himself in the morning without the help of a robot. This is the problem. We are all in the financial system and in the political system and in caring for ourselves and in mental health. Even when we try to organize away from these kinds of things, the pervasive ignorance that has existed, that is purposeful, is still going to affect us. For me, all of this stuff is banding to get to educate as opposed to almost anything else. Does that give you, does that answer your question, Walter?  

(12:49)    
**Speaker 9**:    No, not particularly. Sorry. No, that's quite right. Because like I said, I'm only interested to figure out about DAO and again, I'm still looking for a successful way to build DAO and it'll help if I actually were to find a successful DAO and I'm yet to have that wonderful experience. I'm curious then turning around and looking at this. I just haven't seen at that time in those ecosystems, any progressing, forget about sustainable and somewhat successful, but even like first months type of activities, any course based or political action dos and you would think, and not, it's just doesn't seem to be the vehicle.  

(14:04)    
**Durgadas**:    Well, I see DAO as in a digital, intentional community. Most intentional communities, either a centralized premise or, and it also depends on what you define success with. Right. How is it that you define success according to the current setup or success, according to the Delta of change success, according to the end result one could say that a revolution is a success. You've had let them meat cake, and then they now Frances revolutionary, but they didn't, they didn't change anything really. There was no underlying change in the structure of that you had the Russian revolution, but then what really changed there? Nothing, what I mean? Like you just re they're just reproducing the system with different people at the top of it.  

(14:58)    
**Durgadas**:    Using different pretexts for the same abuse. Right. You're calling yourself comrade, whatever, but are you right? How are you're still above everyone else? Right. I'm just pointing out my view of both intentional communities, which I, 20 years experience that and DAO. I do think it really depends on what your version of success is. If success is just throw the passwords out and you're just recreating the system, I don't know that success, but we can all have different definitions for that. Any other questions please I'd like  

(15:44)    
**Speaker 9**:    Following on that line of thoughts is success defined by the DAO membership, which would be my preference or by some perception of the ecosystem or by some wider, whatever societal means. Of course, to me, the autonomous and self-governing self-determined approaches would imply that the totality of membership in this organizational structure should be defining of their just like they're defining their goals. That should be also defining of measuring successes.  

(16:33)    
**Durgadas**:    I totally agree with you all I've just making an observation about is just that all of the groups that I've seen that jump out of the step one into step C, three, saying that we're gonna do all this ourselves and everything else without a requisite wisdom and understanding of what it actually takes to get there end up failing by their own measurements later on. Then they also don't have any idea why it failed. Right. They're just very unconscious about, well we thought we did everything right., but it wasn't, it wasn't enough. Go ahead, Juan.  

(17:12)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I also think that we are living history in the making and that right now there are multiple formulas to create it out, but we are still continuing in the iteration and the evolution because we find ourselves with this really powerful tool toolings, but we find ourselves reproducing the same culture. Also we cannot give all of our hopes to the technology because technology is blind and who gives the sense of technology is the humans behind it. Working on the humans is the way that we think that we will end up eventually finding the best recipe for these new institutions. It's just an intentional change that needs to be done in the humans so that the technology can be used ethically and for the impact and of the wellbeing of humanity.  

(18:27)    
**Durgadas**:    And this reminds me of Astra Taylor's work a S T a Astra Taylor. She's a person who's written a couple of books and has a couple of movies like documentaries about democracy. She did a great interview on CBC radio. You might wanna look that up, CBC radio, Astra Taylor. The title of it is democracy may not exist, but will miss it when it's gone. The way that I describe people talk about democracy. It's an object when in fact it's a 10 ity system. It's a system that mains its maintains itself through tension. If you, the metaphor I always use is if you pick up a handful of sand. If you squeeze it too hard an authoritarian, then it runs through the, your fingers. If you just let it out too much like an anarchist would then the sand also runs to your fingers.  

(19:26)    
**Durgadas**:    There's a perfect amount of tension, which exists to maintain the integrity of the thing. Do what I mean? And that changes because there are all the time pieces of sand being added and pieces of sand being moved out of the thing. You have to have an appropriate way of dealing with that. This funny thing is that the human body is also a Ted Ty system maintains itself against Gravity through tension. There's systems that Ostrom. If I'm squeezing here, I'm putting in a lot of power, but the thing that's monitoring the mutual monitoring system is actually the parasympathetic nervous system inside. I find that there are parallels between society and the nature of physics and other things too. We should probably be more mindful about obeying some of those structural things, because the way the unity shows up in the duality, you need to be able to find that.  

(20:28)    
**Durgadas**:    And that for me is my physical integrity is maintained by the unity of the opposites as it stacks up through my whole body. When I teach yoga, I often teach about that, but it's true mentally. It's true societally. It's true. That's why I came down to this left and right brain hot. The yoga is about sun, which is the left brain ha, which is the sun and left brain TA, which is moon. That's the psychology, that's also physiology. From my perspective, you need to stack all of those things up in a coherent way to make it work. Yeah, and again, it is evolving all the time, but many of the forces are the same. Even if I evolve and end up with six arms instead a thousand generations from now, Gravity is still all gonna be here. What I mean? And my I'm still gonna have to move all of those arms in the same way. Anyway, so I hope that's not too obscure metaphor, but are there any other questions or anything else Bruno, I see you Z here who goes here, you have questions or comments.  
Bianca0    01:21:43    I don't really have any questions, but I do have a comment as far as just stressing the importance of everything that you're teaching here regarding DAO. I know even within the, just the word decentralization on its own is gives that inner out type of focus on the inside and push out and you really do see it. It's very evident when it comes out to dealing with people. Cause I'm in a DAO 40 acres DAO that is pretty much focused on people of color. A lot of those, a lot of those problems that you face within like the community, you face, everyone you're gonna face within business. Whether no matter what your DAO was doing. I see that from DAO down it doesn't even matter.  
Bianca0    01:22:38    I just wanted to say obviously I appreciate everything that you're doing here. Everyone who's listening understand if you are trying to get a DAO open to start a DAO, these things are extremely important when it comes down to community building, especially when it's, when it's a legitimate community if you want to come in and make a fake DAO and close everything off and make everything, you know? Yeah. That's a lot easier than what's going on as far as that's why these things are so important. That's why you don't see things like this within regular structures. Cause it's not new. It's not common. They don't really care that much about what the individuals doing, you know?

**Durgadas**:    Yeah, no, one's caring for the comments. You have to care for the comments, the individuals and the systems all simultaneously, you have to do all three of those things. It seems to me that in our society, we basically, we set up asymmetric systems that cares only for maybe 2000 people or around the whole world. Do what I mean? And all the other systems are set to Cate and aggregate wealth for, and power and influence for that small group of people. Decolonization is about decentralizing recontextualizing, you have to do all of those things at once and you can't just show up in a place and go, yay. We're all together. We all look the same, so we should be able to accomplish the healing, the, all of these things all simultaneously that just that's, unless you're intentional and that you've, you've, you've inventoried the whole space about what it's gonna take to get there.  

(24:25)    
**Durgadas**:    It's gonna be much more of a challenge because that gives an opening to the extractive abusive side to either show up unconsciously within you and you'll sabotage your own interest unconsciously, or there's just so many ways in which the, that system is set up to prevent dissent or anything else, you know? It's a very big challenge. So, and it is complex. Cuz life is complex and the colonized systems have had 500 years to set up these unequal asymmetric systems for us. We have to do something about trying to make sure that we catch all of the tricks. It's a bit like a magician in a way the thing that you experience on the one side of his magic and you have no idea how it happened. It doesn't make sense, but for a magician, it's just a series of technical steps.  

(25:19)    
**Durgadas**:    Right? And so for me, what I'm interested in is creating an environment in which people can become magicians, where they see the technical steps, but they also enjoy the creation of that feeling of magic in other people. Right. So, and then at the same time, Hey, what, let me come, tell you how it's done. That you don't fall for the trick every time. Right? It doesn't mean you can't enjoy the magic of the series of technical steps or the practice that it takes to be good at them. It just means that you're not a fool about it. What's up.
