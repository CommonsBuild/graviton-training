This character of personal development expectation for the workplace is quite a tall order. On a practical level, personnel require two types of developmental support: firstly, training for everyone in conflict competence, and secondly, individual coaching where it is warranted.

#### Dispute Resolution Services

Additionally, expecting two people to always be able to sort out differences on their own is not realistic. Third-party support for mediation and facilitated group processes should also be available.

### What is Gravity for DAOs?

The Gravity Working Group is a collective that aims to bring people together and promote resilience in decentralized organizations by training its members in non-violent communication, understanding and analyzing conflict and techniques to manage it (internally, individually & collectively). The mission is to help build a culture of wellbeing and high vibes, while also pointing out clear steps to strategically manage disputes whenever they arise. To do this, Gravity needs Gravitons!

### Why?
Decentralized organizations/communities have social structures that are prone to conflict in various scales, contexts, and specific situations. Providing techniques to manage this natural dynamic is necessary while looking for resilience, trust, and  Wellbeing between members. 

This could be seen as Internal laws that apply to everyone and whose legitimacy ultimately depends on consensus.

### How?

#### Prevention 

* Nonviolent, Compassionate, Mindful Communication
* Spiral Dynamics - A Shared Language for Personal & Social Growth
* Transforming Conflict Into Connection 
* Clear Expectations and Boundaries 
* Soft Governance & Cultural build 
* Techniques to return to your optimal arousal zone 

#### Mechanisms to address conflict (Alternative Dispute Resolution) 

Following E. Ostrom’s principles:
4. Rules are enforced through effective monitoring by monitors who are part of and accountable to the appropriators
5. Violations are punished with graduated sanctions
6. Conflicts and issues are addressed with low-cost and easy-to-access conflict resolution mechanisms).

### After training, Gravitons shall be able to:

* Make an effort to be present and accessible to the community, bringing high vibes and improving relationships, bringing the community together.
* Separate the people from problems. Making parties identify with themselves and the other as equals, rather than centering on their own conflictive thoughts-feelings.
* Self-determinate from all parties and recognize key management points by analyzing the information gathered.
* Promote empathy between conflicting parties with emotional intelligence. Building proximity from the abstraction of the problem and the humanization of apparent antithesis.
* Adapt their mindset for tolerance to conflictive situations, keeping calm and diplomacy to stand as an independent third party.
* Propose alternatives to deal with paradoxes while looking for the coexistence and attraction of opposites.
* Act according to institutional regulations while implementing actions to frame unwanted behavior within rules and boundaries (Terms & conditions / Codes of conduct / Graduated sanctions)

### Divided & Unified Ways Of Thinking
#### Divided  
* Educational system focused on external objects given positive value by the society, not the student nor the mind of the student; nor “Reality” itself.
* Materialistic Worldviews dominate (Science Delusion) and limit the available evidence, focusing on patho-myths and denialism.
* Objectivity and Subjectivity are misunderstood as “a very very very long list of objects” and individual perception is completely denied, dismissed and distrusted rather than understood.
* Focus On “Being Right” within the hierarchy’s ‘value’ system. “Right” (according to the social contract) is PARAMOUNT ABOVE ALL ELSE. Therefore “beliefs” supersede all other rationality.
[HERE is a link to a lengthy Powerpoint of this in context with Decolonization.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2bwxv7z6ixwag28/I%20AM%20THE%20PROBLEM-Decolonization-Draft%203.pptx?dl=0) 

#### Unified
* Educational system focused on the student, and their mind’s ‘lensing’ of Reality and their roles within themselves, the family unit, the social fabric and the world and the universe itself; forming a cohesive approach to both inner and outer life.
* Mythologies are used as unified frameworks for imparting vast, complex and contextual understandings for multiple levels of learner development and maturity levels along the path to knowledge of all the roles an individual plays, as previously mentioned.
* The apparent division between Objectivity and Subjectivity in perception was solved thousands of years ago.
* Subverting “belief” altogether is a primary means of knowledge. “The Knowledge That, Being Known, Nothing Else Remains To Know.”
[Here is a video of Regis Chapman (durgadas) presenting this information in detail.](https://youtu.be/lxi76vO-hJY)

### Tuning Into The Unified

[Maya, according to the Bhagavad Geeta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI8Er-OfJj0)\
[Gunas/Personalities According to my friend, Dr. Marc Halpern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzIRZs-vrVc)

Unified thinking is based on the understanding that there is no difference between the world we see and our inner self. And that duality comes from within our mind. “The world appears to you, as your mind is.” 

This graphic illustrates the underlying principles of the mind which creates the duality or Maya, called Gunas.  With understanding, self-compassion and detachment we can turn the various strategies of abuse into health.

### What is conflict?
* **What is seen**: Each participant pushes for their point of view.
* **What is not seen**: Why do they want their opinion to be heard.

![](https://i.imgur.com/oVQfUAE.png)

For conflict resolution, more than a final truth, we need to understand the reasons why each one is attached to their position.

The oranges example: [MediationTools.com - Article: "The Orange Story"](http://www.mediationtools.com/articles/smbj9605.html)

**Deeper questions:**
- What do they want?
- What are their needs?
- What are their interests?
- An expression of difference

### Transformative approach to conflicts
* *Conflict is an opportunity, a gift*. Conflict is normal in human relationships, and conflict is a motor of change. 
* Rather than seeing peace as a static “end-state, ” conflict transformation views peace as a continuously evolving and developing quality of relationship. 
* Conflict transformation is to envision and respond to the ebb and flow of social conflict as life-giving opportunities for creating constructive change processes that reduce violence, increase justice in direct interaction and social structures, and respond to real-life problems in human relationships. 
* *Transformation’s guiding question is this: How do we end something not desired and build something we do desire?*

### Conflict is... (according to J.P Lederach)
* Conflict can be understood as *that which keeps relationships and social structures honest, alive, and dynamically responsive to human needs*, aspirations, and growth.
* Conflict flows from life. Rather than seeing conflict as a threat, we can understand it as providing opportunities to grow and increase our understanding of ourselves, of others, and of our social structures. 
* Conflicts in relationships at all levels are the way life helps us to stop, assess, and take notice. 
* One way to truly know our humanness is to recognize the gift of conflict in our lives. *Without it, life would be a monotonously flat topography of sameness and our relationships would be woefully superficial*. 
* Conflict also creates life: through conflict we respond, innovate, and change.  

### Common problems in conflict management
* Lack of trust in the system’s capabilities to manage the situation.
* Biased or few communication between parties.
* Rock-solid points of view (low negotiation margins).
* Associating ideas to People. E.g. “Castrochavismo”
* Value propositions. E.g. “Good - Bad”
* Ridiculing the problem (not recognizing it).
* Hurting feelings (can trigger people to take irrational decisions)
* Legitimacy of the agreements (what ensures the decision).
* Accountability of decisions and conflict resolution follow-up.

### Window of Tolerance

![](https://worthit2bme.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/window-of-tolerance.jpg)
Pat Ogden describes: we need to understand the window of tolerance so that we can better *understand what is happening to us when we are experiencing distress*.  

*Ask yourself* when managing a situation, am I hypo-aroused or hyper-aroused?
![](https://i.imgur.com/7gv7mIb.png)

### Conflict management as a political philosophy
* *Conflict itself is not bad*. It is an expression of the diversity of interests, ideas and points of view. It arises in all human relationships and, like crises, can be excellent opportunities to grow, emerge stronger, learn and improve.
* When assuming conflicts are negative, people and institutions tend to fear them and adopt one of these two attitudes: 
  1. they resort to force, power or violence to crush them; or 
  2. they ignore them hoping they will pass without addressing them.
* When a conflict arises, both parties may believe they have the only logical stance, since each sees the situation exclusively from their particular point of view. Hence the need and importance of dialogue, as a mechanism that allows the search for collectively constructed solutions through listening and incorporating the other’s perspective.
* The quality of an institution is not determined by whether or not it has conflicts, but by how it manages to address them.
