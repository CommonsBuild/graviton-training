**Breakout questions: What type of community/situation would this practice be best for? Is there a centralized party in this method?**

### Breakout rooms

I love conflict resolution so much and it's very rare that I get to be with this many conflict resolution nerds. 

(00:58:19)    
**Loie**:    Yes. The questions. Okay, cool. The questions here, just pick one of these, one of these conflict resolution methods that's listed up here and answer the questions. What type of community or what type of conflict would this practice be the best for? And is there a centralized party in this method? And I'm hoping you guys can bring back some short answers on those report, back to the big group. Are there any questions about how to actually get into these frames? Actually one, if you wanna just like explain to me and then anyone else who was infused about it. Well know from there.  

(00:59:12)    
**Juan Carlos**:    If you scroll, you can see that Dugas is right now in omega. Yeah, just like we should have around like four people joining him and maybe I will join on commons, voice channel, and yeah. Five people joining me and Alois issues maybe joins in soft go and five people. With you, if we are 20, like four groups of 5 people works.  

...

(01:00:36)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Okay. I will paste the screen of Lois activity in the gravity so that we can follow it.  

(01:00:57)    
**Speaker 16**:    Are we just picking one from this list and then talk about like which situation to be best for?  

(01:01:09)    
**Speaker 12**:    One quick question. Oh, sorry.  

(01:01:13)    
**Speaker 16**:    Oh, go ahead.  

(01:01:15)    
**Speaker 12**:    Thanks. One, a quick question. Is there anybody from met game that have already graduated from graviton from gravity?  

(01:01:30)    
**Juan Carlos**:    No, now we have a lot of people participating, but we have not like the first graduated graviton still.  

(01:01:40)    
**Speaker 12**:    Okay.  

(01:01:49)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Okay. What, which one will we choose? Mm  

(01:02:11)    
**Speaker 6**:    I'm just taking a look at the slide right now.  

(01:02:17)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I would say L litigation like traditional justice system. Do you think that would be a good choice traditional justice system? Or should we choose another one?  

(01:02:48)    
**Speaker 16**:    I'm okay with that if you guys are  

(01:02:54)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Okay.  

(01:02:55)    
**Speaker 12**:    That's it.  

(01:02:58)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I will take some notes. On which cases it's good to use litigation traditional justice system. I would say that when there is no good will from the parts to reach from a negotiated solution.  

(01:03:24)    
**Speaker 12**:    And also when there are clear ways to go out of to yeah. To solve the issue that are already like written down or that there is some type of Juris, prudence or history on how to solve them.  

(01:03:40)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Clear ways to solve the issue.  

(01:03:50)    
**Speaker 16**:    Did you say one if the individuals don't like aren't familiar with each other or did you say something along those lines?  

(01:04:02)    
**Juan Carlos**:    When there's no good will to reach a negotiated solution to yeah. Foster communication and clear ways to solve the issue yeah. Previous experience and I would, Hmm.  

(01:04:33)    
**Speaker 6**:    I almost think it's makes me think of the Caffin model. When things are clear you almost follow that best practices versus you might wanna use a different type of conflict resolution if the parameters are complex or chaotic  

(01:04:57)    
**Juan Carlos**:    And yeah. There is a centralized party in this method party. Maybe we can choose another one so that we do too, because we already said some things about this traditional litigation, justice systems.  

(01:05:27)    
**Speaker 6**:    Almost as if like a broader group of more creative or human based. Like some of the things that I see that might fit into that I'm familiar with are spiral dynamics, ORC or shadow work, where it's focused really on the human connection or relations to human needs.  

(01:05:56)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I also think that maybe when there's an, a need of authority, that would be a case of using this litigation mechanism too. How about if we discuss a bit for the negotiation and mediation? They work really well when they're Goodwill to negotiate. When there are common interest for a possible beneficial outcome for all parts, that negotiation, and there's no centralized party in negotiation.  

(01:07:20)    
**Speaker 16**:    Like if a non zero sum outcome is possible, that lends itself more to negotiation versus like an arbitration by a centralized party.  

(01:07:46)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Now the question that I was thinking is then, which are the ones that are fully decentralized.  

(01:08:04)    
**Speaker 16**:    I  

(01:08:05)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Don't know, because she said about our restorative justice, but actually that's not my strength.  

(01:08:17)    
**Speaker 12**:    What is the difference between restorative justice and decentralized speech resolution?  

(01:08:24)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Okay. Re restorative justice is what she was explaining where there is no like third part, but the system fosters the communication between the two people, but in the centralized dispute solution, we can have a third part facilitating the communication. Of the centralized dispute resolution, something as Claros or argon court that maybe somehow are similar to the litigation system, but they don't work with states.  

(01:09:19)    
**Speaker 12**:    The restoration will be more like a distributive way. There is no middle money.  

(01:09:27)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I, in my experience I haven't been so much near to restorative justice circles, but what I have seen is that they work really well in small communities where like everyone knows each other and the community can like promote the process without having someone like delegated to carry that flag.  

(01:10:02)    
**Speaker 12**:    It would be, for example, if we ha, if we all become gravitons and then we all participate in our community, so let's say that all these communities born by gravitons, then we could take the process forward. That would be more like a restorative, but in this way, also you will need like some roles as you were explaining anything on the first or second session for the, for a person not to gain enough power to be always there, something like that.  

(01:10:37)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Yeah. Maybe when we all are gravitons we can practice restorative justice because there shouldn't maybe in no need of a mediator between the conflictive parts, but that the conflictive parts can talk safely about their conflict within themselves and within the organization.  

(01:11:12)    
**Speaker 12**:    Okay. It sounds like evolution. We all need to get this knowledge and experience in order to carry this restorative approach.  

(01:11:26)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Yeah. I understand it works really well in small communities and a lot of indigenous communities actually here in Colombia, there's also indigenous communities that have this role that is called the word man, El Pareto. He is a person that, he like proposes to the parties a solution., but it's not like an imposition, but it's like what they consider to be fair. It's what the, it's well seen within the group
