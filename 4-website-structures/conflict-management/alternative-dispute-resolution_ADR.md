## What is ADR?

ADR means any method or mechanism of resolving disputes other than litigation. 

The **theory behind ADR** is that settling disputes as painlessly as possible requires good *communication*, that good communication requires some degree of trust, and that *trust* can be built where there is *legitimacy* on the actions taken.  

There are many ADR techniques

- arbitration, 
- mediation, 
- conciliation, 
- justice circles, 
- rent-a-judge, 
- summary jury,
- mini-trial,
- various techniques can be combined to suit your needs

Handled with sufficient skill, ADR can bring an opponent into the venture as well, as all parties join in a **non-adversarial** search for a **mutually beneficial** outcome.

The chances of success for any kind of ADR rely on the premises that parties are committed to the idea of managing the issue peacefully and willing to act in good faith.

According to [The future of ADR in 2020](https://www.imimediation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/the-future-of-adr-in-2020-article.pdf), ADR is prime for proliferation.

* Well established training, tools and techniques in both variety and depth.
* Taught in some business schools.
* Judiciaries increasingly embrace various forms of resolution.
* Success and satisfaction rates are high.
* Arbitrators also embracing ADR processes.
* Governments and enterprise increasingly support ADR.
* Courts increasingly encourage use of ADR.



## how to manage disputes and what are some ADR mechanisms?

![](https://i.imgur.com/lLf3TsX.png)

We are going to start with how, how to manage disputes. As I told before, the two se sessions to previous sessions, where to prevent disputes, to create trust and to see, and to change the mindsets of how we see disputes into something that is not negative or something that we are not closed to, but something that we need to address and manage. 

### What is Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)

> ADR means **any method or mechanism of resolving disputes** other than litigation.

It means any method or mechanism of resolving disputes other than litigation, that is based on communication and of trust and in legitimacy of the agreement, those are the three pillars of alternative dispute, resolution, communication trust, and legitimacy on the actions taken. 

Litigation is one form of solving conflict, but it is a form that is costly both and in human resources. In time to address a conflict litigation is depending on the, on the, on the country can take you several years. These way of handling disputes through litigation does not encourage so much communication or trust rather than the respect of an external authority taking a decision. 

The base of alternative dispute resolution is that the solution of the decision can come from the parties involved. There are many alternative dispute solution techniques in the world and each country like the limits it with loss in a particular matter.  

There are some of ADR alternative solution that are like common between Spanish speaking countries. There are other alternative dispute solution that are framed differently in speaking in other languages. The different techniques of ADR have these same base basis of communication, trust and legitimacy, but they are handled differently and presented differently in each of these techniques. 

There is arbitration mediation, conciliation justice cycle cycle circle rent, a judge program summary jury trial mini trial. There can be like combined forms and hybrid to a particular dispute or legal jurisdiction. 

What I am telling you is that yes, ADR have like this core mechanisms that are like arbitration mediation reconciliation, but there are different varieties and like approaches to handling a dispute with, or an alternative dispute resolution. 

Handled with the sufficient skill ADR can bring an, an opponent into the venture as well as south parties joining in a non adversarial search for a mutual, beneficial outcome and the chances of success for any of the, I AVRs rely on the premises that the parties are committed to the idea of managing the issue, pay peacefully and willing to act in good faith.  

If there is like a war that is, or like if the parties are harming each other, there is very difficult that that ADR will have success ADR will have, is based on that the parties recognize the issue and that they both are trying to put from themselves to solve this case in good faith. 

I am going to have an example that is that the negotiation process, that the, for peace in Colombia, that we had like some years ago, and we had this, we still have our conflict that has like over 60 years of existence is I think the longest civil war in the world. 

In Colombia, there's been several negotiation processes to build peace. One was in 1998 and we had other one in 2014. Even though that the, we still have our conflict and our civil war war in Columbia, the negotiation process that we have for that we have for building peace set the, set the ground for some changes that are being made still in the country. 

Some challenges that we still have to face, because like that negotiation process that we had is not that yes, we ended war and we are not gonna have more conflicts anymore, as we explained in last session. But it was like an agreement for, for some basis that that needed to be addressed in the country so that all parties can benefit.  

### Self-compositive ADR Mechanisms

> **Mediation**: It is a mechanism with which the parties involved look for a third party to help them facilitate communication and build bridges for negotiation, however, this *third party does not have decision-making capacity*, since it must reach the solution through common agreement between the parties.
> 
> **Conciliation**: In this mechanism, the parties involved also go to a third party to help them resolve the conflict, however, *they invest it with the ability to propose decisions regarding it*. The conciliators have to issue a concept that will directly resolve the matter on which the disagreement is presented, but the proposed solution has to be recognized and accepted by the parts.

I am going to go over two big groups of techniques that you can separate them. One are self-compositive alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. They are self-compositive because they involves involve all their parts in the composition of an agreement or on a solution. 

In the self ADR mechanisms, I want to highlight two that are the ones that we are going offers, and those are mediation and consideration. The difference between mediation and consideration is that in mediation, the third part acts like a facilitator for, for the communication of the parties involved and adopts them to fit, to ease the looking for solutions.  

In the mediation, the third part does not propose a solution, just the process, but the solution has to come from the part is involved. Instead of that, in the third part is invested with the ability to propose decisions regarding the issue. But in conciliation, the, this decision is not taken as a bar of a jury, but instead it's taken as a proposal for the parts to accept if the parts. 

### Hetero-compositive ADR - Arbitration

> *Arbitration* is a private process where disputing parties agree that one or several individuals can make a decision about the dispute after receiving evidence and hearing arguments. Arbitration is different from mediation because the neutral arbitrator has the authority to make a decision about the dispute. 
> 
> **Why hetero-compositive?**
> Because in contrast to conciliation & mediation, the composition of the problem is not build from the agreement of the parts involved, but from the decision of the delegated third part.

That is why this ADR needs so much the commitment of the people, because maybe in a consideration process, a ator can give a, a, can propose a solution. Then the, if the two parts, or if the parts involved are not, don't, don't agree with that decision, then they will need to scale the conflict or the solution of the conflict to a higher institution. That is when it comes the hetero AVR. That is arbitration. That is when, when neither the mediation or neither the conciliation work, then you ask for a group of external parties. That should be third.  

(00:11:21)
**Juan Carlos**:    You invest them with the, with the ability to make a decision on the dispute. But the decision of this arbitration process is imposed to the department. that is the difference between hetero composite and self composite. Compos is when the parts are involved in the, in the, in the proposed solution and that they have to agree with it. Arbitration is when they rely on the, on the, on the decision that is taken by, by this third part. In, in the gravitons basically are, are going to be mediators. Conciliators in doubt that that is basically what they're going to do. That's like the scope that we have after this training that we can approach to our community and offer this service, if people is having disputes, or if the community is having a dispute, then we will be able to ease the communication in that, in that dispute, if it's the case of our mediation, or if it's a reconciliation, we can like propose solutions, but our solution, it's not like AIC, or it's not, it's like an advice process and some, and yes, a solution that can have the problem, but what legitimate the solution is the commitment of the parties to agree with that.  



### Self-compositive ADR Mechanisms

**Mediation**: It is a mechanism with which the parties involved look for a third party to help them facilitate communication and build bridges for negotiation, however, this third party does not have decision-making capacity, since it must reach the solution through common agreement between the parties.

**Conciliation**: In this mechanism, the parties involved also go to a third party to help them resolve the conflict, however, they invest it with the ability to propose decisions regarding it. The conciliators have to issue a concept that will directly resolve the matter on which the disagreement is presented, but the proposed solution has to be recognized and accepted by the parts.

### Hetero-compositive ADR - Arbitration

**Arbitration** is a private process where disputing parties agree that one or several individuals can make a decision about the dispute after receiving evidence and hearing arguments. Arbitration is different from mediation because the neutral arbitrator has the authority to make a decision about the dispute. 

**Why hetero-compositive?**
Because in contrast to conciliation & mediation, the composition of the problem is not build from the agreement of the parts involved, but from the decision of the delegated third part.

### Steps for a mediation process

1. **Planning**: Before the mediation process begins, the mediator helps the parties decide the communication mechanisms and **observe** with them who should be present in the process.
2. **Introduction**: With the parties gathered together, the mediator introduces the participants, outlines the mediation process, and lays out ground rules. And presents the goal for the mediation process: to help the parties come to the Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA).
3. **Opening remarks**: Following the mediator’s introduction, each side has the opportunity to present its view of the dispute without interruption. In addition to describing the issues they believe are at stake, they may also take time to express their **feelings**.
4. **Joint discussion**: After each side presents its remarks, the mediator and the disputants ask questions with the goal of arriving at a better understanding of each party’s **needs** and concerns. If parties reach an impasse, mediators diagnose the obstacles and work to get the discussion back on track.
5. **Caucuses**: If emotions run high during a joint session, the mediator might split the two sides into separate rooms for private meetings, or caucuses.
6. **Negotiation**. At this point, it’s time to begin formulating ideas and **requests** that meet each party’s core interests. The mediator can lead with all parties in the same room, or can engage in “shuttle diplomacy,” moving back and forth between the teams, gathering ideas, proposals, and counterproposals.

### Why doesn't centralization work?
* Recidivism
* People do not experience healing in court
* Massive profit for private justice system companies

(01:12:34)    
**Loie**:    God is still joining us. Originally I thought we could report back on this, but for now I really wanna get to talking about practical implementation. Just briefly, why doesn't centralization work in justice or in conflict resolution? 

we can see that it doesn't work because of recidivism. Recidivism is a fancy word for people returning to the criminal justice system. After they've already been through it they go to court, they are sentenced to prison time. They go to prison, which is supposedly a correctional facility, which if it was doing any correcting, they probably would never come back there. 

We see massive rates of recidivism up to 80% in some demographics for certain crimes. We know it's not working. Also people don't experience healing in court. My restorative justice teacher, wonderful woman named Andrea Rennicke. She was a lawyer and her turning point was realizing that people came to her looking for peace and for healing. Instead she brought them to war. and that was her job as a lawyer bringing them into court. 

Another thing is there's too much opportunity for like really bad profit models, at least in the United States. There's a whole industry around like private justice system companies. It's not just jails that are privately run. 

It reaches into the social work sector. It re reaches into weapons manufacturers. Actually a lot of the companies that own private prisons also own like military weapons, manufacturing companies with big contracts, government, and also own and operate our like social work offices. 

We've we've outsourced that to private companies. Then they have an incentive to really not do what they came there to do, but actually to continue the cycles of poverty and exploited families.  

(01:15:32)    
**Speaker 18**:    Can I just mention one thing? Before centralization occurs, it seems to me that if we centralize our education system, what a community or culture educates is what it becomes. We educate people in this punitive and reward system. Then it's inevitable that we'll end up with centralization out of that and will inevitably end up with a punitive and reward justice system. Before all of this parts that you're talking about now it's profit for everybody. If what I'm saying, it keeps everybody absolutely at every layer all the way down the line.  

(01:16:14)    
**Loie**:    That puts an extra spin on the school to prison pipeline. Right. We even like a lot of us experience it in our families. This punitive justice systems and kids not feeling like they have agency over the decisions around conflict in their lives and that someone else needs to make a decision for them. It starts early. That's a great point. 


## TABLE 1.5 Steps Typically Used by a Private ADR Center
* Alternative Dispute Resolution Center Manual A Guide for Practitioners on Establishing and Managing ADR Centers

1. One of the parties to a dispute (referring party) approaches the ADR Center and requests a mediation.
2. The ADR Center provides a list of names of available mediators from which the parties may elect their mediator.
3. The parties provide the ADR Center with all the relevant documents pertaining to the dispute, and the ADR Center provides this information to the mediator.
4. The ADR Center, in consultation with the parties and the chosen mediator, determines the date and place when the mediation will take place. The ADR Center may offer premises for conducting the mediation. A few hours or a number of days may be allocated for the mediation, depending on the complexity of the matter and the number of parties involved.
5. If the dispute is settled through mediation, the parties enter into a Settlement Agreement. Often the ADR Center will keep a copy of the Settlement Agreement on file for its records.
6. If the dispute remains unresolved, the referring party may request that the matter be arbitrated by the ADR Center, if this is the agreed process to be followed by the parties (for example, in terms of the contract between the parties). Alternatively, the parties may agree to arbitration. If the parties do not agree to arbitration , they may follow the recognized route for resolving disputes in that jurisdiction (for example, approaching the court for a court order).
7. Once again, the parties will elect an arbitrator. The arbitrator will conduct the arbitration on a date and at a time as agreed between the parties.
8. The arbitrator adjudicates the matter and provides an arbitration award, which is normally binding between the parties through operation of law or by agreement of the parties.
