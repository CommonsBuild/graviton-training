## Behavior is Not Intention
(00:49:18)
**Speaker 3**:    One question about beliefs and desire beliefs and intention. You had a link there to an article, definitely will read that, but can you share, can you go into that a little bit? Behavior is not intention.

(00:49:52)
**Durgadas**:    So the reason I included this, because I felt like this is I included most, mostly relevant links to things that made sense with respect to conflict resolution and part of the, the fundamental thing about conflict resolution and the spiral in general. The reason why I'm bringing it up is that if I'm a person who is, for example, confused about my feelings and needs, and I'm confused about when is a demand, a demand and not a request. 

If somebody just says anything that I ask for, even if I treat you in a bad way, you should just give me right. If a person's confused about how to not make good observations, and instead just goes just gives you a string of judgments what's gonna happen often. There is, is that they, because they're confused about it. 

Doesn't and because they can't tell the difference between those things does not mean that they're intention is fundamentally right. It does not mean that they're, they're just a jerk

The point really is to break off a person's behavior from their intention, by understanding that the behavior that they're doing might arise from a confusion of all of those things that we were talking about before, about, about feelings over needs. They might not even know that it's okay to have needs, and they don't know how healthy ways to express those. Right. When you're a, Gravitant somebody who has to be able to see beyond you have to be detached enough from your own feelings,  

In terms of somebody else's feelings and needs, and to understand their feelings, even when they don't understand their needs, even when they don't to make observations that prevent a person from reacting, with negative feelings to make requests in such a way that they don't feel that you're making demands of that. Right. 

Often when you're making a request, if you can say, can you please make sure that you come to my party next time. You could say, well, how come you never want to come to my party? Or you treat somebody badly because they didn't come to your party. Do you know what I mean? 

A person who's confused about those things is not going to be able to align their behavior with their intention. As gravitons not only do we have to do that, we also have to be able to see the specific feelings and needs, or at least be able to make an educated guess about what those things are underneath that person's confusion. Hopefully that answers your question.
