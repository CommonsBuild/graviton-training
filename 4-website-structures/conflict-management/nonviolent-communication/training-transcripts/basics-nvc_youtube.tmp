i have a situation with my intimate partner that many times we get together
157:34
we argue a lot and i have this need that you were saying earlier is inappropriate
157:43
that i want her to be happy i didn't say it was inappropriate
157:47
i said it was undoable ok, right
157:50
that's what she keeps telling me if you're gonna tell me to be happy
157:57
tell me the action to get there that i can do
158:02
if you tell me an action that you predict that if i do that
158:05
i'll be happy at the end it would be helpful
158:08
tell me the action don't just tell me be happy
158:11
don't tell me to have confidence in myself tell me what you would like me to do
158:15
to feel that confidence the action will get me there
158:18
but just telling me what to feel puts me into a paradoxical bind
158:24
okay well one of the other things would be when we get together
158:31
i don't necessarily want to be going somewhere with her if she's not
158:37
in a good mood at that time if there's some kind of tenseness
158:40
or something yes, then empathize with why i'm not in a
158:42
good mood and i'll be in a one
158:46
but telling me that i've got to be in a better mood
158:48
for you to wanna go with me gets me in a worse mood
158:55
okay um, i'm wondering if there's some times
159:04
when it's... i'm feeling some anxiety about a trip i'm planning to visit my mother
159:13
soon, and we have a dynamic where she really wants to help me
159:17
figure out every detail of what i'm doing during my stay
159:20
and i've like to be left alone so, let me show you what to do:
159:24
and i'm afraid that if i talk to her like this, it's gonna make matters much worse
159:29
okay, then we'll teach you how if it does we'll show you how to enjoy it
159:34
if it gets worse but first let me show you
159:38
the first thing for you to do if we wanna person to consider
159:41
another behavior than the one they're doing start the communication by showing them that
159:47
what they're doing is the most precious thing they could be doing
159:52
this way: empathy start by empathizing what mother's intent
159:57
in behaving as she does mother i'm guessing that when you jump in
160:01
and want to show me all the things that could be done
160:05
you really care a lot about enjoying myself on this trip
160:08
and wanna be sure you support that oh yes yes
160:11
yeah, so it's really very important to you that i have a good time and you wanna
160:18
contribute to it yeah
160:21
that's step one see what i mean
160:23
that's what i mean by starting by showing you understanding
160:26
now the more aware, concerned about that behavior the more important it is to start with this
160:33
that's why when i work in prisons and this person has been sexually molesting
160:37
people, or raping people if i would like this person to find another
160:41
way of behaving the first thing i've gotta do is make sure
160:45
they don't hate themselves for what they're doing
160:47
the more they hate themself for what they're doing
160:50
the more they'll continue doing it so i start by empathizing with what their
160:56
needs are in doing it
160:57
okay, so you've got that step the next step, what we started off the day
161:03
with i tell honestly how i feel
161:07
i'm feeling torn right now cause i'm grateful for your intent
161:10
but i really have a need to kinda make my own choice this year
161:14
cause i think it would be really hard for anybody else to really know
161:16
what i need and i need a space to figure it for myself
161:19
so, would you tell me what you heard me say, mother
161:23
so i can see if i'm making myself clear? so now i know mother didn't hear me
161:38
now i know mother didn't hear my needs she probably heard a rejection
161:44
she probably heard that she's not valued so it is important that i not think that
161:50
her reaction is because of what i said if i express my feelings and needs it would
161:56
be impossible for a person to react this way
161:58
if they heard it they would have gotten a gift
162:01
they would have the eyes of a little child getting a gift from santa claus
162:06
that doesn't look like what mother's looking right now
162:10
so mom could you tell me what you just heard me say?
162:14
you don't want me so, you heard a kind of as rejection, mother
162:20
of course, how else could i have heard it? well, thank you for telling me you heard it
162:25
as a rejection, mother notice i didn't say that isn't what i said
162:31
see if you wanna make it
162:34
if you want to have people understand you differently
162:36
never tell them: you're misunderstanding me never say: that isn't what i said
162:43
say, thank you for telling me that's what you heard
162:47
i can see i didn't make myself clear i'd like to try again, mother
162:51
cause i do value very much that you're offering to help
162:54
but i have a need to kinda get my own needs clear and
162:57
structure my own time can you tell me what you heard me say?
163:04
so you think i don't have any intelligence about helping you?
163:08
thank you for telling me that's what you're hearing, mother
163:11
i'd like for you to hear it differently i'd like you to just hear my needs
163:16
that i have a real need to kind of sort things out for myself and structure my
163:20
own time could you tell me what you heard?
163:24
so you have a need to kinda get clear for yourself
163:28
what you want and to figure things out thank you, mother
163:32
see how easy it is to get empathy from a jackal? just about three ear-pulls and i got it right?
163:41
now there're some eight-pull jackals, too i know
163:45
but i can tell from how sweet you are your mother is a three-pull jackal
163:48
thank you yes?
163:53
you mentioned earlier this morning that enjoying suffering
164:02
could you elaborate on that? yes, oh yes
164:04
that's very important thank you for being in debt to me about it
164:08
okay, a friend of yours says this to you: i'm a nothing
164:17
i'll never amount to anything look at... i'm an assistant clerk at 8's 45
164:23
my brother's a head of his company my sister's a top attorney
164:29
and i'm a nothing okay?
164:34
now, to enjoy this person's suffering we have to release ourself from two kinds
164:39
of responsibility first, that we didn't cause the pain
164:46
that we wanna release ourself from that especially if the other person's trying to make us believe
164:51
we did cause the pain if this person had started: and you're at
164:55
fault for all of this, why i'm a nothing
164:58
especially when a person says that we do not want to in any way think
165:02
we caused this person's pain cause you can't cause another person's
165:06
psychological pain well in this case the person wasn't saying
165:11
that so that's pretty easy to
165:14
liberate ourself from feeling responsible but the second one is the hard one
165:21
to think we have to fix it to make the person feel better
165:25
the more we think it's our job to make the person feel better
165:29
the more we're gonna make it worse cause you can't fix people
165:33
the good news is, you don't have to there is a very powerful healing energy
165:40
always available if we don't block it
165:45
and how do we block that energy? by trying to fix things ourself
165:52
so how do we help that energy to do the job? by empathy
165:58
empathy requires presence just to be present
166:02
when we are just present when we are remembering the buddhist advice:
166:06
don't do something, stand there when we do that, and that energy works through
166:14
us there is a precious connection between that
166:18
person and us and that precious connection is what i mean
166:23
by enjoyment to enjoy that precious connection
166:26
and whether this person's feeling joy or pain
166:32
if we are present there with them that's what i mean
166:38
but we block that beautiful energy whenever we step in and think we have to fix things
166:44
so we say, oh, there there you'll feel better you'll get over
166:46
we make it worse when we start to give advice
166:50
we make it worse so what does that look like?
166:56
so you're feeling really discouraged and really would like to have achieved more
167:01
in your life at this moment than you've done yes, yes, had every opportunity, and look
167:05
at me i've just never made use of anything
167:07
yeah, so you're really discouraged and frustrated and would really have liked to make
167:14
different use of some things than you have yeah
167:18
see? i'm just present not trying to fix it
167:22
and when that happens there's a very precious connection
167:26
that's what i mean by enjoyment and that precious connection does the healing
167:31
not your advice, not your whatever yes?
167:35
can you clarify the distinction between empathizing and sort of encouraging and supporting the
167:43
soap opera of you know, somebody who is
167:47
somebody who is suffering and sometimes by being there it's sort of
167:55
a subtle encouragement as opposed to
167:59
the subtle encouragement that i think you're talking about comes about
168:04
when this person is talking about what happened to them
168:07
for the fiftieth time you heard the story so, if i'm really listening to them
168:12
i don't hear what they talk about the past cause i know that the more they talk about
168:17
the past the less healing will take place
168:21
so i interrupt but i interrupt to bring the conversation
168:25
to life they're talking about the past and
168:28
i interrupt then and i say excuse me but sounds like right now you're still
168:32
feeling hurt because your need for respect wasn't met in
168:37
that see, cause just letting them talk about the
168:40
past and asking them questions about what happened
168:43
about the past is to just keep the soap opera going
168:47
so i interrupt when they talk about the past cause we don't heal by talking about the past
168:54
we heal by talking about what's alive in us right now
168:57
stimulated by the past but it's what's here now
169:01
and when i connect at that level they won't keep talking about it
169:07
they'll heal last question and then i'm going to get into
169:11
the subject that i'd like to cover before the end
169:16
yes? you talk about having
169:23
if someone else can not cause our emotional pain
169:27
that's right and i think about
169:32
the abuse that i grew up with and that i see in a lot of families
169:36
and the suffering that i've experienced throughout my life
169:39
through my recovery and all that yes and other people were a stimulus for
169:44
your suffering and you were participant in how you dealt
169:48
with it for example:
169:52
if you follow me in my work you would see this
169:53
very clearly in places like rwanda, burundi, sierra leone
170:01
i'm working with people that have had their families killed
170:04
some of those people have such rage that all they live for, moment by moment,
170:09
is the possibility of vengeance others have no anger
170:14
have never had anger same exact stimulus
170:17
they have deep feelings but not rage
170:21
so it is not the stimulus that determines how our emotional reaction is
170:26
that part is up to us i work with some women
170:32
unfortunately a lot who've been raped
170:35
and some of them feel shame deep shame
170:41
some feel rage some feel other things
170:45
so the same stimulus depends on how people take it
170:50
whether they feel shame, rage, or other things i'm working with a woman from rwanda
170:58
she heard her three children being killed cause she got... to underneath the sink
171:02
hid underneath the sink in time her children didn't make it
171:05
to the hiding place in time they got killed she heard them
171:08
she heard her husband being killed and her brother
171:11
she had to stay underneath there eleven days to save her own life
171:15
cause they stayed in their house after they killed the family
171:19
this woman has deep feelings but never once has she had that kind of anger
171:24
that makes her wanna get vengeance she's put all of her feelings
171:27
and lots of them into protecting preventing this happening to anybody else
171:33
so the way she looked at it leads her to want to prevent this happening
171:37
to anybody else she came to my workshop
171:40
because she wanted to know how to deal with the rage toward her
171:43
from other people in her tribe who are furious with her
171:46
that she won't join their efforts to kill the other people
171:52
same stimulus quite different reactions
171:56
okay, so i had this stimulus and somewhere i learned how to deal with it
172:02
in a way that i had to deal with it and i'm learning to change that now
172:06
the worst thing of course would be to now matter how you did choose to deal with
172:09
it is to think there's something wrong with how
172:10
you chose to deal with it
172:11
that not wanting us to get into one way is right or wrong
172:15
I'm just saying that no matter what happens to us
172:18
the other person's responsible for what they did
172:21
i'm not saying the other person doesn't have responsibility
172:23
that's my question about accountability that person's responsible for what they did
172:27
and why they did it we're responsible for how we deal with that
172:33
okay? i'm just wondering how a child becomes responsible
172:43
i mean still you know the first thing i do
172:46
i wouldn't wanna teach the child the lesson i just taught you
172:49
until i had given that child all the empathy that child needed
172:52
and i guess it would be a lot so i can see myself dealing with a long time
172:58
of hearing this child's enormous pain
173:01
as a result of this but then, in the course of this
173:05
i would be seeing this child having some pain created by how they looked
173:10
at it so i would see that they're creating
173:13
pain on top of the pain by how they looked at it
173:18
so, after the child had all the empathy he or she needed
173:23
then i would do what i could to get them to see it in a way that
173:27
wouldn't create unnecessary pain for themself this is a debut jackal, yes
173:42
okay, now what i'd like to do in that precious time
173:45
that we have left to deal with a very important part of giraffe
173:48
cause i wouldn't want you to get the idea that non-violent communication
173:53
is solely interested in conflict resolution because it's equally interested
173:58
in celebration how can we celebrate life
174:02
in fact the part that i've left for ten minutes before the end
174:05
is in some respects the most important part because it's where we get
174:09
the fuel to stay giraffe in what's often a very jackalish world
174:17
so it's gonna be pretty hard to make this radical transformation
174:20
to back to our nature in many situations unless we're getting plenty
174:27
of fuel now where does this fuel come from
174:32
the fuel comes from celebration and what kind of celebration?
174:37
comes from saying thank you in giraffe so let's see now in the last minutes
174:43
how we celebrate by saying thank you in giraffe
174:47
expressing gratitude in giraffe and first i'd like to remind you
174:53
of how jackals say thank you: you did a good job on that paper
175:01
you are a very kind person you're a good dancer
175:07
can why that's jackal? moralistic judgments
175:13
positive moralistic judgments are equally as violent in my estimation
175:20
as negative ones mainly they reinforce the idea that
175:23
the negative exist if i say you're a kind person
175:27
i'm implying there's such a thing as an unkind person
175:30
i'm also implying that i'm the judge that knows the difference
175:35
so no more praise or compliments, okay? no more praise or compliments
175:39
especially if you intend them as a reward that's the ultimate dehumanization
175:45
to use thank you as a reward to say it for the purpose of
175:50
trying to reinforce something to get the person to continue doing it
175:54
it's like sending a... you know, what what gets on at dog obedience
176:00
school? punishment and rewards
176:03
giving a compliment or praise for the purpose of reinforcement is giving the dog a
176:08
something to eat, to reinforce it for something people are not for that treatment
176:14
and it destroys the beauty of thank you
176:18
when people have to wonder - is this being said out of that energy?
176:24
but it works! what does, jackal?
176:27
studies in management indicate that if managers praise and compliment employees
176:32
they lead production goes up studies in school show that if teachers
176:38
praise and compliment students daily they work harder
176:42
jackal, take another look at the research i think you'll see that that only works
176:47
for a very short time until people see the manipulation
176:51
and then it no longer works and it destroys the beauty of thank you
176:58
because now you can not even trust gratitude
177:02
without wondering whether it's being used as a reinforcement
177:05
as a reward well, what about if i wanna build up the other
177:10
person's self-esteem? what's wrong with that?
177:13
so, you, jackal, you don't see the irony of that?
177:17
what? if the other person can only like themself
177:20
if you compliment them they have no self-esteem
177:22
you just addicted them to your rewards that they only feel good when you say
177:28
something about them they have no self-esteem
177:33
okay how does a giraffe say thank you?
177:38
or gratitude? first, there's three things that are involved
177:42
in giraffe expression of gratitude that give
177:45
us energy to keep being a giraffe
177:47
the first thing in the giraffe expression of gratitude
177:51
is we bring to this other person's attention concretely, what they have done
177:57
that has made life more wonderful for us see, that's what we need to do, daily
178:03
we need to bring our consciousness and attention to the power that each one of
178:09
us has to make life more wonderful
178:14
each of us is a power house we have words that have the power
178:22
to contribute to making people's lives more wonderful
178:28
we have touch, we can touch people in ways that can make life more wonderful
178:34
we can provide services for other people we are powerhouses
178:40
the more we remember this we'll not get caught up in any violent games
178:47
why would we use our energy any way other than to make life wonderful
178:52
when we remember that we have this power so that's one thing we gotta make clear
178:58
in our expression of gratitude specifically what the person did
179:02
not some vague generality for example, a woman in Geneva, Switzerland,
179:08
came up to me at the end of a workshop here's what she said to me:
179:12
you're brilliant i said, doesn't help
179:17
she said: what do you mean? i said, you know ma'am, i have been called
179:22
a lot of names in my life really, i have, some positive, and some far
179:27
less than positive and i can never recall learning anything valuable
179:31
by somebody telling me what i am i think there's zero information value in
179:37
being told what you are
179:39
and great danger - you might believe it and it's just as dangerous to believe that
179:44
you're smart as that you're stupid
179:46
both of them reduce you to a thing we're much more than either of those
179:57
but i can see in your eyes that you want to express some gratitude
180:01
yes - and i wanna receive it, but doesn't help me to be told what i am
180:05
what do you need to hear? what did i do to make life more wonderful
180:09
for you? well, you're so intelligent
180:12
no, doesn't help doesn't help. what did i do?
180:17
oh, i got you. she opens up her notebook she shows me two things that i had said she
180:24
had written down she put a big star by them
180:27
see, that helps me now, okay that helps me to know that somehow my saying
180:33
those two things made this person's life more wonderful
180:38
so that's the first thing we need to say in appreciation
180:42
we need to bring to the person's attention concretely what they did
180:46
that made life more wonderful second, at the moment we're giving the gratitude
180:52
to say how we feel at that moment about the person having done that
180:58
so i said to this woman: could you tell me how you feel now
181:02
as a result of my having said those two things? she said: hopeful and relieved
181:07
oh, hopeful and relieved that gives me much more than telling me what
181:13
i am that i'm brilliant
181:16
just to know that somehow my saying those two things
181:18
now this person feels hopeful and relieved now when i hear the third thing i'll be able
181:25
to really enjoy this gratitude i said: what need of yours was fulfilled by
181:32
my saying what i did that leaves you feeling hopeful and relieved?
181:37
and that's the third thing we need to see in a giraffe gratitude
181:42
she said: i have an 18-year old son i'd never been able to connect with him
181:48
it's been very painful that we never can connect and i have needed some direction
181:54
to help me connect with him those two things you said
181:57
met my need for some concrete direction so, had she expressed her gratitude in giraffe
182:06
she would have said, marshall, when you said these two things, showed me
182:10
what the two things were it leaves me feeling hopeful and relieved
182:14
it meets a need of mine to connect with my son in a way that i want
182:21
okay, that's how we say gratitude in giraffe those three things
182:25
and it's also important how we receive gratitude let me show you how a jackal receives gratitude
182:34
jackal, when you offered to give me the ride just now over to where i'm going afterwards
182:39
i feel very grateful because i really have a need to spend
182:42
more time with my family and if i took the bus
182:45
i'd have an hour less time it's nothing
182:56
if you wanna terrorize a jackal, express love or appreciation to him
183:01
really, if you really wanna scared jackal i've never seen anything scare jackal-speaking
183:08
people more than sincere gratitude or love
183:12
why do you get so nervous, jackal, when you hear it?
183:16
well, i don't know that i deserved it see. jackals have this dangerous concept in
183:24
their head - "deserve". a very violent concept
183:28
it implies that you have to deserve appreciation you have to... you do deserve punishment if
183:36
you behave in a certain way see the concept of deserve is a key ingredient
183:40
in a violent way of life if you believe in deserve you believe certain
183:45
things are worth things and you set up a very destructive economic
183:49
system you'll set up a destructive correctional system

saying that we have enormous power to make life wonderful
185:11
