Let's just get right to the nonviolent communication side of the picture. There are, again, a couple of links in here that actually talk about the original idea of the unified way of thinking is the NVC world and the world. As most of us know, it is this divided way of thinking, and it actually blocks connection. Instead of understanding, and making, making nonjudgmental observations about the world, we do intend to make an observation and immediately interpret it. 

Then often we speak our judgment about that. Rather than saying if somebody's not showing up for things, and you would say "*I've noticed you've been not here for the last three or four meetings. Is there something going on with you?*" instead of doing that, we often say you're never at these meetings what the hell?  

This is an interpretation, judgment problem. It also applies to ourselves. If I was really nervous about giving this presentation, for example, I might, instead of saying geez, I'm really noticing that I have a need to be accepted by all the people I'm presenting to and understanding how I feel and what my underlying needs are and making good observations about maybe my leg shaking or something instead, I'm just going, geez, I just suck at this or that's not good. 

We do that externally in social situations, but we also do it internally with ourselves. There's a suggestion here about how to go through and try to think about things in a more unified way.

What's great about non-violent communication for me as a person on the autism spectrum, I always felt like there was always like pane of glass between me and other people that I'm speaking to.  

I hope you can appreciate what a vulnerable position this is even for me to be talking in front of a large group of people like this as a person on the spectrum who has been systematically bullied over most of my life and treated like an other. and it's actually a very big deal for me to be able to think about myself in terms of understanding myself as Ia' to talk to myself in the, in the terms of a draft, as opposed to thinking of myself in terms of this Wolf language.  

I'm gonna encourage you guys to take a look at the, the videos on the Giraffe language. The first one is not very long. The second one is, is prior audio book. It's about an over an hour long.

[The 4 NVC STEPS MADE SIMPLE (VIDEO)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkgbrZSAY0)

In any case to talk about the conflict resolution cycle of nonviolent communication, there's a very simple mnemonic that we use to talk about this, and that's the OFNR process. You essentially make observations using facts as opposed to evaluating things. Then you create a connection by making this observation and then observing the feelings and emotions that are happening either within yourself or within the other. 

One of the things that you start to do when you're in this communication cycle, is, is that you, if somebody's expressing the feelings that they have, one of the things that you're looking for intentionally is to the need that they have.  

For example, if a person was saying I'm feeling excluded, that's generally not a feeling that's a judgment of what you're doing to them. Instead of being in a situation where you immediately go and judge them on the basis of that, what you might guess as to what their feelings is and connect it to a need that's underneath that. 

For example, I could say, so you're feeling sad or upset or angry that when I didn't invite you to my party or whatever your need for inclusion was not being met. If you ask that in a form of a question, then I think so, well, they can give you some feedback about it. They could say, well, not exactly. I'm more disappointed because we used to be closer and now I'm not even invited to your party thing.  

Then you can really uncover what's really going on when you, when you think about things in terms of feelings, what I've, it's my observation that a lot of people don't understand what feelings are. 

They think that feelings are words that end in ed. For example, they say, I'm feeling excluded, feeling excluded is not a feeling. It's more of a, what my intention was about by not including them in the party and their need for inclusion is an actual need. 

People really confuse their feelings and their needs. It's incredibly important to develop a language for that. There are a lot of feelings and needs wheels that exist on the internet that you can take a look at to identify those things within yourself. 

I learned to identify them within others. It's my suggestion that you, as graviton start to be more intentional in how you talk to yourself and in how you talk to others and try to hear when feelings exist and try to hear when needs exist and taking a look at the feelings and needs wheels that you can just Google search for.  

That will really then help you understand these two fundamental blocks, this red and blue block, the feelings and needs part. Then once you understand what your feelings and needs are, if I was the person who wanted to come to the party, you could then say, yes, I'm feeling sad because I miss our connection from before, because my need for connection with you has not been met. 

Then you could say, as a result of that, I'm really missing you. I'd really like to be invited to your party. That would be then the request aspect of the, the final resolution part of that conflict. Now, if you've got two people who can, instead of creating and me images of each other like it would be very easy for someone to do who is feeling excluded, so to speak you can then make really good requests at the same time.  

If that person requests they be included in your party. There may actually be very good reasons why the person would say no. At the same time, even though the person has clearly expressed their feelings and needs, it could be that the request would, would be told no. You can actually hear from the there's there's requests. There's also demands. 

A demand is basically like an emotional blackmail situation where a person basically says, you either say yes, or I'm gonna treat you badly, but a person might say, no, just as easily. If you can't hear no to one of your requests, that basically means it's a demand. and then that would actually prevent the connection from happening and it would prevent a person's choice. 

It would perpetuate the conflict by not being able to hear no in the, because you've, you've formed your request in terms of a demand. So what it's a good suggestion is to learn how the places where you're being demanding or doing emotional blackmailing, or when that's happening to you on the other side of it, so that you can then plug it back into the observations and say, okay, so maybe there's something that's missing. 

For example, in my, in my invitation to the party situation I'm gonna say no to you coming to my party, because my partner found out that we used to date 20 years ago, and they're just not comfortable with that. and so that would be an observation. Then of course the person would likely have some feelings around that. 

As you keep going through this process, the intentionality and the lack of conflict goes down and down over time, because you're able to uncover what's really going on by keeping yourself out of this judgment, confusion about emotions and needs and making good requests as opposed to demands. Hopefully that's pretty clear. 

## Questions
Now that we're about a third of the way through the presentation. I'm happy to answer questions on the NVC side of things.

(00:24:51)
**Solsista**:    Hey, cool. Thanks for, for making this possible. Basically again, maybe just a remark, I think the point even starts because most of us have problems discerning needs and then feelings. So, right. That was definitely an aha for me. Yeah.  

(00:25:18)
**Durgadas**:    Yeah. Yeah. That's part of the reason why we're having this training and I think it should be an ongoing thing for gravitons in particular, but for anyone in the community, all of this stuff is really unclear in many ways. Part of the thing about what I think we're in intentionally doing here and gravity in particular intended to do is to proactively educate people about the way that this cycle works and so that they can contextualize their feelings and their needs and how to get requests and how to make observations both in the personal level, on the interpersonal level. Me and SM just talk, we're gonna have the same thing, but also how to construct the, the systems, which support our work in token engineering in the first one place, and even in the common stack and even another Dows that we interact with all of these things have different contexts.  

(00:26:24)
**Durgadas**:    And all of this is all based contextually as well, right? Because if a person is violating a principle of like Ostrom talks about, of the overall community, right, we would need to discuss that at the appropriate level. If it's just me and seb going seb, why did you dye your hair? I don't like your hair that way and blah, blah, blah. Then she'd be like, oh my God. You know? And so it was just something between us. It's a, it's a very different contextual situation. It, and it does really require practice to be able to implement these things in the given context that that you're in. 

That's part of the reason why I'm a huge believer in practice groups. If you can find an NVC practice group in your area, or you can either physically or virtually attend given COVID or come to the spiral dynamics group to take a look at the depth of this stuff that exists. There is a bit of a similarity in the sense in the spiral of this four, these four aspects, which are contextualized slightly differently spiral, but we'll, we'll get into that in the next section. Anybody else have any other questions or comments?  

### Nonviolent Communication

**a) [Brief summary of Non Violent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg](https://srinathramakrishnan.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/non-violent-communication-summary.pdf)**

This is a chapter outline of key points related in Marshall Rosenberg's [Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life](https://puddledancer.bookstore.ipgbook.com/nonviolent-communication--a-language-of-life--3rd-edition-products-9781892005281.php). (PuddleDancer Press)

> If "violent" means acting in ways that result in hurt or harm, then much of how we communicate—judging others, bullying, having racial bias, blaming, finger pointing, discriminating, speaking without listening, criticizing others or ourselves, name-calling, reacting when angry, using political rhetoric, being defensive or judging who's "good/bad" or what's "right/wrong" with people—could indeed be called "violent communication." 

> Nonviolent Communication is the integration of four things: 
> * Consciousness: a set of principles that support living a life of compassion, collaboration, courage, and authenticity  
> * Language: understanding how words contribute to connection or distance  
> * Communication: knowing how to ask for what we want, how to hear others even in disagreement, and how to move toward solutions that work for all  
> * Means of influence: sharing "power with others" rather than using "power over others"  

> Nonviolent Communication serves our desire to do three things: 
> * Increase our ability to live with choice, meaning, and connection
> * Connect empathically with self and others to have more satisfying relationships
> * Sharing of resources so everyone is able to benefit
