## Transcription

(00:01:57)    
**ddan**:    I'm not an expert in the practice of nonviolent communication but I've seen how becoming more fluent in these teachings will help me to meet my need to connect with the people in my life, more compassionately. 

I have studied this material for pretty thoroughly over the past couple years, but that intellectual understanding has it's helped me to keep in mind and other people's perspectives a little easier, but the it's not quite the same as practicing. 

Hopefully we can, as a group, move from understanding into practice sooner than later. 

Non-violent communication is a language, a way of thinking communication skills means of influence and a practice. 

There's quite a bit of philosophy surrounding nonviolent communication. It seems like a really simple idea, but it's actually pretty complicated how it all relates in with each other. 

The basic idea is that it supports in connecting with ourselves and others in a way that promotes compassionate giving and that we never want to. We always want our giving to be done willingly, not out of guilt, shame, fear of punishment, or by trying to buy love submitting to people's expectations. 

I don't know about you all, but for me that's pretty mind blowing already because that's almost exactly the opposite of how I've tried to live.

Whether through schooling or even just non formally through social settings, it seems like these things run through our motivational systems. 

## Origin

### Marshall Rosenberg

![](https://i.imgur.com/ACr4DHd.png)

If you don't know about Marshall Rosenberg, He got into the study of psychology to try to determine what happens so that some people seem to enjoy creating suffering in others, and some people enjoy relating compassionately and enjoying contributing to the wellbeing of others. 

He saw that some people just really love to make others suffer and then some people just really love connecting and contributing compassionately to life. That's short version of where it all came from.  

He determined that violence is that violence is created by a way of thinking and a language and a use of power where some claim to be superior and know what's right for others. 

That to maintain domination structures, people are educated with the static language that judges what they are, that identifies them as a certain type of person based on their behavior, their appearance and their intelligence. 

Does that resonate with us here? Does it sound familiar?  

(00:09:03)    
**Speaker 3**:    We're just putting this one into the gravity survey about what's most difficult to that. I find what's very difficult with STR in a community and with the violence of speech or enjoying promoting someone else's suffering, specifically in crypto cultures, but also in the internet, it's a very meme friendly type of culture and dog piling can be such an easy part of it because it's fun almost for people to identify a mistake or something silly. Imagine thinking this is a good track or something like that. So quickly it can spiral into this. Oh, now you're making fun of someone, but you're just having fun as well. That I understand what you mean by the martial Rosenberg or I can see the desire to add to other people suffering because I don't know, maybe perhaps it's already been gamified or something like that. It's very easy to do.  

(00:10:10)    
**ddan**:    Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. What he's what he's suggesting is that's not an accident or a chance that it comes to be that way. Does anybody else have any thoughts or reflections on what Marshall sees as the source of violence?  

(00:10:41)    
**Speaker 5**:    I have something that came up when I looked at this slide in particular made me think about a conversation I had with my daughter this weekend. We've been talking about power dynamics, social ones status and how people do things to maintain power dynamics. In order for there to be popular, people there have to be unpopular people. They have to create these scenarios to validate their experiences. That's just like bringing a lot up when I look at this and about language and how I use it and the comment before me with just the internet and the dog piling and yeah. How people feel good when they get validated. I just see that happen so much on the internet, people picking on somebody or shaming them for making a mistake, as opposed to supporting them. It just brings all those thoughts up and how we communicate and just how it's not good.  

(00:12:55)    
**ddan**:    And we can get our meet needs for connection with our community met in this way that doesn't necessarily meet our needs for respecting other people in their full humanity. Yeah. Awesome. 

There was a question about people who have, who want to control situations and that's a lot of what nonviolent communication wants to help us manage those situations. 

How do we connect with these messages and people who are communicating in these ways then and how can we connect in a way that maybe we can get all of our needs met?

(00:14:25)    
**Speaker 2**:    When we were reading the book, I, the second chapter, he made a reference about Hannah rent and how sometimes we think that the like most violent things that have happened were made by men without hearts, or that are different than us. He says that and also reflects on that evil is very ban the finality of evil and that really the evil things is just people who is not really taking the full responsibilities of their actions. Sometimes they're just following yeah. Some institution or some rule to back up their action. Nonviolent communication promotes responsibility, and we have the free will to act in one way or another.  

(00:15:41)    
**ddan**:    That's what we're trying to get at here is that the idea that there's good guys and that there's bad guys and that the good guys have to they have to punish the bad guys to win. We're coming up next with that in retributive justice. 

### Myth of Redemptive Violence

The idea that when people are right wrong, good, bad, however, you're judged by the authorities, then you deserve to be rewarded or suffer pending. Then Walter wink noticed this pattern of the "[myth of redemptive violence](https://www2.goshen.edu/~joannab/women/wink99.pdf)" that, of the good guy and the bad guy.

What I'm trying to get at is that the, when we have these binary static images, then it's very hard to look at ourselves as someone acting in ways aren't contributing to others' life. 

When there's only the good guys and the bad guys, we gotta be the good guys and somebody else has gotta be the bad guy. It makes it really hard to explore our own problems where we're not serving life in our community.

> a story told often enough, and confirmed often enough in daily life, ceases to be a tale and is accepted as reality [...] people accept the story even if it is destroying their lives  – [The Powers That Be: Theology for a New Millennium](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Powers_That_Be.html) Walter Wink

## Process

Now we're gonna try to get through just what the main ideas that rather than judging whether someone's right or wrong and whether to punish a reward with non violent communication, we're focusing on what's happening to human needs, our needs, their needs.  

(00:18:24)    
When their actions, when actions aren't fulfilling needs, then we can change to actions that will fulfill needs. When our needs are met, we can celebrate. 

Just the idea that we can do all that without creating the enemy image of the bad guy and the good guy, and but that paradigm is also it's meeting people's needs for connection at the expense of the needs of everybody else in the community. 

Doesn't meet all the need, but it's important to understand when we're thinking about how do we replace these destructive systems that they're there for a reason because they are fulfilling their fulfilling need. It's just important to keep that in mind.  

He just says that the conflicts can be resolved when we get out of this defensive posture. It's like a meme or a complex, or we get triggered by something and instantly into judgement that's not focused on the needs and the situation. 

#### OFNR

**Observations • Feelings • Needs • Requests** 
 
> Nonviolent communication suggest we make clear observations that tell people when their actions are meeting our needs, and when their actions are not meeting our needs.

The process of nonviolent communication involves observations, clear observation, doesn't analyze or judge the behavior, but just action, pure action-language feeling, which is not how you think about what they did, but actually like I feel stressed or I feel sad or I feel mad or whatever. 

Then to the needs, which we'll get to shortly, there's a whole list of needs that can browse through. Then if our needs aren't met and on a clear request, what can meet our need in that moment. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/0eVGOeq.png) 

If you listen to the recordings of Marshall Rosenberg, he does a lot of Jackal and giraffe language. The Jackal language is when we're judging what people are: we're addicted to our strategies; We're making demands of people. 

In giraffe, because giraffes have the biggest heart and they have the long neck to reach for what the feeling and need is. 

#### Observation
**Statements of fact without judgement or evaluation**

Marshall always loved to quote this ability to observe without evaluating the highest form of intelligence. 

[![](https://i.imgur.com/o4g8HvZ.png)](http://legacy.jkrishnamurti.org)

#### Feelings 
indicate whether needs are met. 

When we feel good, our needs are being met. 

When we feel bad, that lets us know some need of ours isn't being met. 

**The process starts**, maybe you are having problems with someone, or they are having a problem with you (observation). You are guessing what they feel, or you are sharing feelings stimulated by whatever problem you just explained with them.

We've divided feelings into a list of when needs are met and when they're not met. A big part of nonviolent communication is just gaining a literacy and becoming more comfortable having on hand at any moment, a set of nine feelings that you could that you can better than good or be good and bad how you're feeling in a particular moment.

What Dr. Rosenberg suggested is going through these lists and picking out which words you would use in your natural language. Cause when you start practicing this, it might feel a little jilted at times. We're aiming to use this process as part of our natural expression. 

#### (We all share the same universal) Needs

We all share the same needs. This is one of the fundamental principles.  

[![](https://i.imgur.com/FQaYUli.png)](https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/needs-inventory)

**When our needs are met, we enjoy pleasant feelings**

**When our needs aren’t met, we experience unpleasant feelings**

(00:25:34)    

One of the fundamental principles of nonviolent communication is we all have the same universal needs. The same as with the feelings we want to come up with a list of need words, that you will use in your everyday language.

#### Requests
**Clear action to fulfill needs, now**

After a clear expression of our experience, with an observation of what someone did and how we felt in relation to that and what were the cause of those feelings. 

Then we are providing a clear request on what that person can do in that moment to help us meet those needs. 

It's not enough to clearly express how we feel in relation to behavior that has offended us, and the needs attached to those feelings. 

In nonviolent communication its important that we make a clear request on how they can help to correct the situation. We must find some clear action that will allow us to clear the air for both parties involved, a clear request that can be fulfilled presently.

(00:27:50)    
**Speaker 2**:    Also there's a difference between requests and demand. When we make a demand, that's a type of communication that blocks compassion. When we make a request, we recognize the free will of the other, but we encourage the other to be motivated through our needs and feelings.  

(00:28:27)    
**ddan**:    Absolutely, and as I've gotten to explore nonviolent communication, more deeply, it helps me to recognize subtle aspects of relationships where it didn't come out as a demand. 

In Nonviolent communication whether its a demand or not is based on what happens if they don't do what you requested. 

We can get into destructive games in our relationships without necessarily being aware because of this training that we've gotten around the type violent communication trying to transcend.

### thoughts, questions.  

(00:31:03)    
**Speaker 8**:    One thing that's come up for me, as I've explored this model of nonviolent communication, is just how difficult it is for me to communicate my feelings. Just staying in the feeling words and not even like analyzing, it's really easy for me to analyze myself, or to say that I feel like you're not listening to me or something that's not a feeling.

**ddan**:    Yeah, for sure. As in nonviolent communication, as Marshall has shared with us, is that feelings, if any time you say "I feel" should relate to our emotion or else it's not clear. 

I feel that you don't care is a judgement, very different than saying I feel hurt when you respond in that way. 

I hope that's clarifying a little what we're getting at here. I didn't take notes on that too deeply.  

(00:32:55)    
**Speaker 9**:    If you say that, I feel that you're doing something that you're stating a judgment, you're not actually stating a feeling. These are called faux feelings. Right?

(00:33:05)    
**Speaker 9**:    What feelings do is provide you with a way of avoiding responsibility for your own feelings. This is so pervasive and that's why everyone feels like they're essentially projecting thier judgments upon someone else without taking responsibility for them. If you say I feel disrespected, that's a judgment of what you think the other person is actually doing when in fact you're not really sure. You're just projecting your idea about it. There's a lot of words that you end with ed, which are I feel disrespected as one of them. 

If you say, I feel sad or I feel angry or feel whatever when you do some specific thing, that's a far better way of making the person clear about what it is that you're feeling. 

(00:34:34)    
**Speaker 3**:    Would you say there's a difference between feelings and thoughts then? Well, that you're not listening to me rather than I feel like you're not listening to me. I feel heard or ignored when you're not listening, but it's a thought of mine that you are disrespecting me. Something like that.  

(00:34:51)    
**ddan**:    It's an analysis yes. Or judgment. Yeah, for sure. Thanks for jumping in on that. Appreciate it.  

(00:35:05)    
**Speaker 2**:    That he promotes the understanding that we are the owners of our own feelings. We shouldn't see on others, the feelings that we're feeling, but rather see the feelings within ourselves. Also the feeling is the signal, but what comes after the feeling is to identify the need that is behind the feeling. Sometimes you may say, continuing with this example, I feel disrespected because you are not hearing me, maybe the need is security or attention. 

We should be responsible for our feelings and not like giving that responsibility to what others do. That continuing with that same example of, I feel disrespected, maybe what is the need behind that feeling and that judgment, and if it's attention or security, so that you can like really understand what is the root of the communication that you want to have and not like maybe yeah. Adding layers of complexity. That non-violent communication also tries to express things like the most simple way possible, so that the message is delivered. When we give or like give the responsibility of our feelings to the other, we cannot express our, what is really inside the bus.  

(00:38:13)    
**ddan**:    We're coming towards the end of the hour. I just want to highlight, and that a big part of what that this training taught, not only to help us increase the harmony in our relationships, but to protect society and humanity from dangerous forces that aren't people in organizations seeking to meet their needs at the expense of the needs of others. 

For some reason, when I come across nonviolent communication, I feel like that part gets left out, but that, and I also wanted to show how the same process is used in gratitude because maybe that'll help to see how the same pattern is used, where when we're sharing gratitude. 

Marshall says the person who's receiving the gratitude can get a lot more out of it, if, rather than saying "you're incredible", which is a judgment. Instead we want to make a clear statement, what actions of theirs have enriched our lives, and which needs of ours were fulfilled, and then how we feel as a result. 

It's the same thing when we have a problem and we're focusing on what they're feeling in that moment, what need is being disrupted? 

It's this **observations**, **feelings** **needs**. 

That's the rubric with which nonviolent communication uses to connect in all of our different types of interactions that we have in our relations. Yeah, if anybody else wants to add something to that.

(00:42:19)    
**Speaker 2**:    I would like to say that first is the understanding of these concepts, but then comes the practice. The practice is always the most difficult part, but by being conscious of the types of communication and the communication mistakes that we are normally doing, we can start making small changes in our life. 

I wasn't really clear with when I was talking before. What I wanted to say is that we are the owners of our own feelings and we should be responsible for what we feel and trying to give that responsibility to others. The others are not the owners of our feeling, weird donors of our feelings. We should be responsible by also how we think and how we feel it's like being the master of your mind and the master of your body.  

Sometimes we live too much in our minds and our minds can behave like a crazy horse and through nonviolent communication, we can tame that crazy horse and being able to ride it. That's the same, that's the same. What, when we are trying to communicate with others non-violent communication is a framework that helps to go over the prisoners' dilemma and not like everyone taking a decision without taking into account the other, but to try to take the best decision possible, taking into account the needs of both parts.  

(00:44:14)    
**Speaker 9**:    Well, and the other part about this, that's beautiful about using language that accepts responsibility is there's a, there's a switch in how you feel internally after some practice in time using this in terms of how much agency and autonomy you feel yourself. It may seem a bit awkward at first because we're growing up with words and phrases and methods of communicating that remove our ability to feel those things, but over time it can really gang up on you. It's a very beautiful side effect.
