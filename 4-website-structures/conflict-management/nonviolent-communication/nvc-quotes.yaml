Life-Enriching Education: an education that prepares children to learn throughout their lives, relate well to others, and themselves, be creative, flexible, and venturesome, and have empathy not only for their immediate kin but for all of humankind

-
NVC can be effectively applied at all levels of communication and in diverse situations: intimate relationships, families, schools, organizations and institutions, therapy and counseling, diplomatic and business negotiations, disputes and conflicts of any nature.
-
There are the two main reasons we don't get our needs met. First, we don't know how to express our needs to begin with. Second, if we do, we forget to put a clear request after it, or we use vague words like appreciate, listen, recognize, know, be real, and stuff like that.
-
As NVC replaces our old patterns of defending, withdrawing or attacking in the face of judgment and criticism. We come to perceive ourselves and others, as well as our intentions and relationships, in a new light. Resistance, defensiveness, and violent reactions are minimized.
-
Some use NVC to respond compassionately to themselves, some to create greater depth in their personal relationships, and still others to build effective relationships at work or in the political arena. Worldwide, NVC is used to mediate disputes and conflicts at all levels.

-
It's important that when we address somebody that we're clear what we want back.
-
If I'm using Nonviolent Communication I never, never, never hear what somebody thinks about me. Never hear what somebody thinks about you, you'll live longer. You'll enjoy life more.
-
Never hear what somebody thinks about you, you'll live longer. You'll enjoy life more. Hear the truth. The truth is that when somebody's telling you what's wrong with you, they have a need that isn't getting met. Hear that they're in pain. Don't hear the analysis.
-
Life-Enriching Education is based on the premise that the relationship between teachers and students, the relationships of students with one another, and the relationships of students to what they are learning, are equally important in preparing students for the future.
-
Conflicts, even of long standing duration, can be resolved if we can just keep the flow of communication going in which people come out of their heads and stop criticizing and analyzing each other, and instead get in touch with their needs, and hear the needs of others

-
Peace requires something far more difficult than revenge or merely turning the other cheek; it requires empathizing with the fears and unmet needs that provide the impetus for people to attack each other.
-
Aware of feelings and needs, people lose their desires to attack back because they see the human ignorance leading to those attacks. Their goal becomes providing empathic connection and education that will enable them to transcend violence & engage in cooperative relationships.
-
It is a rare human being who can maintain focus on our needs when we are expressing them through images of their wrongness.
-
To know how we can be peaceful with ourselves when we're less than perfect. For example: How we can learn from our limitations without blaming and punishing our self?  If we can't do that, I'm not too optimistic how we're going to relate peacefully out in the world.
-
Nonviolent Communication training shows people how to create peace within themselves and at the same time how to create connections with other people that allows compassionate giving to take place naturally.
-
Look out at the structures that we've created. The governmental structures and other structures, look at whether they support peaceful connections between us, and if not, transform those structures.
-
Nonviolent Communication consists of a value system that we are trying to live by. It outlines a language, thinking, communication skills, and means of influence that support that way of living.
-
Two questions were in me: What happens to people to lead them to enjoy and want to contribute to other people's suffering? What happens to human beings so that we stay with the process of compassion where we enjoy contributing to each other well being?
-
I wanted to learn what contributes to violence, and do whatever I could to transform it, to prevent it. To learn about what helps human beings to stay connected to our compassionate nature, to do whatever I could to live that way myself and distribute what I learned to others.
-
I found that the tools of psychoanalytic therapy, and other trainings which were current at the time, didn't work very well. Instead of diagnosing what it was in people that's wrong with them, I decided to start with a different question: How were we meant to live?
-
The skills that seem necessary to live compassionately are quite different than the skills that we're taught.
-
Structures we're living in, where some claim to be superior and know what's right for others, requires a certain way of thinking, a certain language, and a certain use of power I saw that was the problem. What creates violence is that way of thinking, language, and use of power
-
I decided to a different kind of research to observe the people I respected the most, who seemed the most compassionate, who seemed to enjoy giving to others. I tried to see how were they different than the people who seemed to enjoy criticizing, blaming, and attacking others.
-
It was through studying [compassionate] people, and also some research in psychology, that I tried to identify what characteristics of development contribute to people's behaving in a compassionate way.
-
Nonviolent communication evolved from the research that I did to identify what kind of human development is necessary for us to live compassionately.
-
The process that I call nonviolent communication consists of an intention to contribute to our own well being, and the well being of others, compassionately.
-
What I mean by compassionate giving is, first of all, whatever we do is done willingly, not done out of guilt, or shame, or fear of punishment, or trying to buy love by submitting to what we think others expect us to do.
-
I saw that the intention I wanted to live by, that I thought necessary for compassionate giving, is that we give solely out of the joy that comes naturally from contributing to life. Our own life and the lives of others.
-
In my private practice, people came to me with depression. Children were sent to me because of problems in school. Couples came to me with marital problems I found the process I was putting together much more effective as a healing tool than how I was taught to do psychotherapy
-
The purpose of nonviolent communication is to provide us with the language with the thinking, communication means of influence that support and connecting with ourselves and others in a way that promotes compassionate giving.
-
For about 10,000 years over most of our planet, people have been operating according to what I call domination structures in which some people claim to be superiors and have the right to control others because they know what's best.
-
How do you educate people to be submissive and obedient? You need to teach them a language in which they get disconnected from their own power and look to authority to guide how they ought to live.
-
To maintain domination structures, a core component is to educate people with a static language that uses the verb to be in ways that judge people, their behavior, their appearance, their intelligence.
-
Retributive justice basically implies that if you are judged as bad by the authorities, you deserve to suffer for it. If you are judged by authorities as good, then you deserve to be rewarded.
-
Teaching people to think in a static way, in terms of good/bad, right/wrong, normal/abnormal, appropriate/inappropriate, mentally normal/mentally ill, combined with retributive justice based on punishment and reward, I believe, is at the heart of violence on our planet.
-
Nonviolent communication focuses our attention on human needs, whether human needs are being fulfilled or not. When they're not, obviously what is called for, is to find ways we can behave that nurture these needs. This is a radically different way of thinking.
-
Instead of judging right or wrong, to determine whether people are punished or not, are rewarded or not; nonviolent communication focuses on what is happening to our needs.
-
If our needs are not being fulfilled by what is happening, let us take action that fulfills our needs. If our needs are being fulfilled, let's celebrate.
-
This is a radical departure from the language of domination, a language of judging what people are. Nonviolent communication suggest clarity about whether actions are supporting needs being fulfilled.
-
Nonviolent communication suggest we make clear observations that we can tell people, when their actions are meeting our needs, and when their actions are not meeting our needs.
-
Feelings are manifestations of what is happening to our needs. When our needs are not being fulfilled. We feel unpleasant feelings. When our needs are being met. We feel pleasureful feelings.
-
When we see that our needs are not being fulfilled, we need to request of ourselves or others, what actions we would like taken to better meet our needs.
-
Four components makeup nonviolent communication. Our needs, and observations of what is fulfilling our needs and what isn't. Feelings to identify the results of what's happening to our needs. A request what we would like done about our needs that are not being fulfilled.
-
Nonviolent communication involves sharing what's alive in us. What would make life more wonderful? to receive the same information from other people, to connect with what's alive in them, and what would make life more wonderful for them.
-
I've found that anytime people hear criticism or demands, that makes it very difficult for people to enjoy contributing to one another's well being.
-
We want people to know that we never want anything done, that we request, out of guilt or shame created by criticism they hear coming from us.
-
I believe that anytime we influence people with criticism, blame, insults, even if they do what we request, it will be very costly to us.
-
Schools, families, and governments are all set up on the basis of retributive justice, the idea that there are certain things you must do, and if you don't you deserve to suffer, and if you do things defined as right by authorities, then you deserve to be rewarded.
-
Anytime we get people to do things out of fear that we're going to punish them if they don't, or out of shame or guilt, it's very costly. We are then experienced as a source of violence, as somebody who is prepared to make them suffer if they don't do what we want.
-
Asked for examples of Amtssprache, Eichmann said it's a language in which you deny responsibility for your actions. If you don't feel responsible for your actions, you don't feel so bad when you do things like send people to their death.
-
Nonviolent communication is designed to help us remain conscious of choice every moment to believe that every action we take, we choose to take. We don't necessarily like some actions that we take, but we don't do anything we don't choose to do.
-
Words like have to, should, ought, must, and can't, are dangerous as I would define danger, because they turn out people who don't feel responsible for their actions. Nonviolent communication is a language that heightens our consciousness that we have choice.
-
Every moment of our lives, we have choice. Nobody can make us do anything.
-
It simply says, Let's stay connected to life, the life within us. Like any other form of life, whether it be a tree or animals, life requires being connected enough to life to know how to fulfill our needs. So in that sense, Nonviolent Communication is a very simple process.
-
The reason it's so difficult is that it requires liberating ourselves from centuries of education that have buried what's alive in us. Cultural education that is designed to make us nice dead people, not compassionate living people.
-
Nonviolent communication requires quite a transformation from how many of us have been programmed to communicate. Many of us have been programmed to communicate in a language of categorizing people and their actions to judge what they are, for doing what they're doing.
-
I thought to myself, how can I go through a day without insulting people? My brain had been programmed to think in terms of what people think of me. Will they judge me right or wrong, good or bad, appropriate or inappropriate? And I was taught to judge others this way.
-
OJ Harvey reviewed literature from different cultures to see how often the verb 'to be' was used in judging people's actions, good\bad right\wrong and found a high correlation with measures of violence - violence toward oneself, violence toward others.
-
The more cultures think in terms of what people are and their actions, the more violence in those cultures.
-
Anger, Depression, Guilt, Shame These four feelings are very helpful because when we feel these feelings, we can use them as an alert that we're thinking in a way that's contributing to violence on the planet. Here is an opportunity for us to transform that thinking.
-
Anger, Depression, Guilt, Shame Whenever we're feeling those feelings, we're thinking in a way that we've been taught to think for about 10,000 years. A way of thinking designed to make us obedient to authority, but is not conducive to safety and peace on our planet.
-
Anger, Depression, Guilt, Shame We can use those feelings as a wake up signal. Wake up, we're thinking in a way that's not conducive to peace on the planet. Let's transform the thinking into one that promotes peace on our planet
-
On the subject of anger, that's a good feeling to teach us nonviolent communication, because anger tells us that we are disconnected from our needs, the central part of nonviolent communication. Anger tells us we're thinking in a way that creates violence on the planet.
-
I tried to make clear to you that it's never what other people do that makes us angry. It's how we think that makes us angry.
-
Anger is caused by how you think, language that is disconnected from your needs, and makes violence enjoyable." 
-
All you need to do to make violence enjoyable is think there's bad guys, and that these bad guys deserve to suffer for what they've done. That can make it enjoyable for you to create pain for these people.
-
Anger tells us, in other words, that a need of ours isn't getting met, but our thinking doesn't connect with that need. Our connection goes to judging the other person who was the stimulus for our anger.
-
We can only be angry when we get disconnected from life, and go up to our head, and think in a way we have been programmed to think, in terms of wrongness of the other person.
-
I'm not saying there's anything wrong with being angry. That would be unfortunate if I come across that way, because a lot of people have been educated to think that if you're a nice person, you don't get angry. They've been taught to repress their anger. I'm certainly not saying that.
-
No matter what you might say to them, do you think you are more likely to come out with your needs met if, in your head you have judgments of them implying wrongness on their part, or if you are conscious of your needs?
-
This principle is very important to liberating ourselves from language which is not conducive to our well being or peace on the planet Awareness that all language implying wrongness, criticism, insult, diagnosis of pathology of others, all such languages are the cause of anger
-
All language implying wrongness, criticism, insult, diagnosis of pathology of others, all such languages are the cause of anger. Other people are never the cause, only the stimulus.
-
Anger is a distorted expression of an unmet need. A distorted expression that not only interferes with getting the needs met, but makes it enjoyable to be violent to others.
-
Ask yourself, wait a minute, what need of mine is not getting met thats being expressed through judgment of the other person?
-
We live in a different world when we are connected to what is alive in us and meeting our needs. We live in a different world than when we are up in our head, judging other people in terms of rightness and wrongness.
-
Learning how to become literate with a language of life, and our needs, is going to take some practice. We're going to need to practice transforming language which stimulates violence into a language of life.
-
"Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. I'll meet you there." - Rumi
-
I was very skilled at judging what's wrong with other people in a way that would make me angry. But I wasn't very skilled at understanding my needs, getting connected to my needs.
-
It would sometimes be awkward when I was angry, because I would stop right there at that time, take a deep breath, identify the thinking making me angry, connect to the need behind it, and then I would open my mouth.
-
He said, Dad, its taking you so long to talk. I said, let me tell you what I can say quickly, do it my way or I'll kick your butt! He said, Take your time, dad. People who have known me in the days before I learned nonviolent communication are very patient when I take my time
-
One way in which we can make our own life much more enjoyable, is whenever we are thinking in a way that is causing anger, depression, guilt, or shame, to transform that thinking into what need of ours is being distorted by the thinking that's causing those feelings.
-
In the exercise where I have asked people to identify what they tell themselves when they have made a mistake. Once they identify this thinking, I then suggest that they transform that thinking into the need that wasn't met, that stimulated the thinking.
-
All of the thinking that makes us angry, depressed, guilt or shame is a tragic expression of an unmet need. To really learn from this mistake without losing self respect we need to mourn but to mourn without blaming.
-
This is a very important difference in nonviolent communication between mourning and blaming ourselves. Mourning requires that we be connected to our need that wasn't met by our behavior.
-
Mourning requires that we be connected to our need that wasn't met by our behavior. When we're connected to that, we might feel sadness, frustration. These are quite different feelings than how we feel when we blame ourselves and feel the depression, guilt, shame.
-
We suggest that everyone build at least a vocabulary of about nine words that describe various needs that you have and see if one of those words, or more, resonate when you're blaming yourself.
-
The quicker we can transform a thinking of blame into a thinking of unmet needs, the quicker we'll be able to learn from our mistakes without losing self-respect. This kind of self empathy, empathizing with the need being expressed behind self blame, we call that mourning.
-
Be conscious of what you tell yourself as a result of making the mistake, and translate the self-judgment into an unmet need. That's mourning. Then empathize with what need you were trying to meet by the action that we're calling a mistake. That's self forgiveness.
-
In my clinical training, I was taught to look at depression as an illness as a mental illness. I now come to see it in quite a different way. [...] I find that depression is created by people judging themselves in a way that creates that depression.
-
When I'm seeing somebody who's very depressed, I ask, what needs of yours are not being met? They very seldom are able to tell me that. They haven't been educated to be conscious of their needs. They've been educated to blame themselves and others.
-
I ask, What needs of yours aren't being met? They say, "I'm a failure." I asked about needs, they tell me a judgment of themselves. I point out this difference: "You're telling me now what you think of yourself. I'm asking what need of yours is not being met."
-
I try to show people it's this kind of thinking that makes us depressed. What we tell ourselves about ourselves. We judge ourself in a way we've been trained to judge people. These judgments that imply badness, wrongness, inferiority, abnormality, that creates the depression.
-
Once people identify these judgments that create their depression, I show them how to transform the judgments into unmet needs.
What a different world we live in when we get connected to the need that isn't getting met, rather than stuck in the ways we judge ourselves.
-
When we think in the static language of what's wrong with us, that are we selfish, stupid, inconsiderate. When we have that language going on in us about ourselves, that doesn't lead to us getting our needs met. Our needs are buried behind that kind of thinking.
-
The structures we've been living under for a long time require people to be nice dead people. They teach this language of blame, so that we're forever looking to authorities to see whether we're getting the right answer, or the wrong answer, whether we're judged as good or bad.
-
When we feel pleasurefull feelings, we know that our needs are being fulfilled. When we feel painful feelings, or unpleasant feelings, we know our needs are not being fulfilled. To be fully alive requires a language of life. That requires a language of feelings and needs.
-
Another thing we need to liberate ourselves from if we want to really enjoy being human, we need to liberate ourselves from thinking that we cause other people's feelings.
-
We need to see what we can be responsible for, and what we are not responsible for. When we get this mixed up, we can be victimized by guilt tripping.
-
Other people can't make us feel anything. Our feelings are a result of how we take things. We cannot make other people feel as they do. They are responsible for how they take it. We show we're not responsible for how other people feel. We are responsible for our actions.
-
The goal of life isn't to be perfect. It's to become progressively less stupid.
-
Let's learn from our limitations. Let's learn from our errors, and see them as opportunities to develop ourselves.
-
Keep in mind that anything that's worth doing is worth doing poorly.
-
We didn't judge students as bad, but we spoke honestly with them about whether or not their behavior was in harmony with our values or needs. We judge that way, but not judgments of a moralistic sort that implied wrongness.
-
I was also in favor of rules, but that I showed him a different way of establishing rules based on the protective use of force and not the punitive use of force
-
How concerned I am about thinking we have to be afraid of what other people might say or think about us. By doing that, we're giving our power to other people. I tried to show people that we need to be concerned with how we respond the other person, not what they think of us.
-
That's where our safety is, in how we learn to respond to other people's judgments or criticism of us. Not to give our power away by thinking that our safety is solely how they might respond.
-
Our safety is in how we respond to other people, not in how they respond to us. We have all these choices when people say things to us: we can take it personally and feel shame; we can judge them and feel angry; or how we can empathically connect with them
-
Don't ever give up your security to the structures you're in, or to other people's messages toward you.
-
Never give the structure, or the people in it, the power to make you submit or rebel
-
Help our children to learn how to come from their own spirituality, how to answer for themselves, "what is the way I choose to live?" and learn how to sustain that, staying conscious of it regardless of the structures you're in, or how people in those structures speak to you
-
No matter what structures we're in, never give the structure or its rules the power to determine what we do, so our actions come from choosing to act in harmony with our values. This way, we're not submitting or rebelling. We're acting in harmony with our own values each moment
-
Walter Wink, the theologian, says it's very important to be conscious that institutions have their own spirituality. Many structures are set up in a way that are designed to get people to obey authority no matter what they want us to do
-
We're interested, in nonviolent communication, with the kind of honesty that supports people connecting with each other in a way that makes compassionate giving inevitable, that makes it enjoyable for people to contribute to each other's well being.
-
Retributive justice judges people as right or wrong, good or bad – with attachment to – if you are good, right, appropriate, etc, you deserve to be rewarded, but if you are bad, wrong, etc. you deserve to suffer, be punished, etc.
-
The idea that if you are good, right, appropriate, you deserve to be rewarded, but if you are bad\wrong, you deserve to suffer\be punished. It's my belief that that kind of thinking is the basis of violence on our planet. It's a way of thinking that makes violence enjoyable.
-
This kind of honesty basically involves telling people what's alive in us, without using any words that criticize, and tell people what would make life more wonderful for us, what we are requesting, without presenting this as a demand, but presented as a request.
-
It's very important to be able to made clear observations to people, that tell them what language on their part is stimulating our needs being fulfilled, and what things that are doing that are not fulfilling our needs.
-
We can learn by clear observations, but when the observations and evaluations are mixed together, so that it sounds like a criticism, it makes the evaluation period painful for both sides.
-
In nonviolent communication, we want to be sure that whenever we want to talk to somebody about something they're doing that we're not happy with, that we clearly put this in the form of an observation.
-
Our evaluation needs to be focused on the life within ourselves, which to me means it needs to contain reference to our needs. We need to let people know what needs of ours are being met or not being met by their behavior, and how we feel as a result of it.
-
When we tell people clearly our feelings and needs, we're letting them know what's alive in us when they do what they are doing, this is an evaluation based on life, not an evaluation, criticizes or blames.
-
This form of evaluation requires a literacy of feelings, that we tell people how we feel when they behave in a certain way.
-
Many people use the word feeling and thought interchangeably. In nonviolent communication, when we use the word feeling, we want it to refer to an emotion that a person is experiencing that doesn't contain any diagnosis or intellectual analysis of the other person
-
Feelings would be: I feel frustration, I feel sadness, I feel irritation, when our needs are not getting met. When our needs are getting met: I feel happy. I feel joyful. I feel pleasure.
-
We have been living under domination cultures in which some people claim to be superiors and have a right to control others. People do not make good slaves when they are connected to life, and so feelings are not regarded as a positive thing to say.
-
Not only aren't we educated to speak a language of life, a language of feelings, we have been given a cultural education that has a very negative connotation to many of our emotions.
-
We learn very quickly in life to cover up our emotions and hide them. Even though if we want to relate in a way that promotes compassion between ourselves and other people, feelings are a key ingredient.
-
Painful feelings tell us our needs are not getting met. Pleasure feelings tell us our needs are being met.
-
This requires a need consciousness, and a need literacy, which is not easy to come about. Because, once again, the structures in which we have been living for a long time, require us to be educated in a way, in which, we are not connected to our needs.
-
Many women tell me what difficulty they have, expressing their needs. They have been taught that loving women have no needs, they sacrifice their needs for their families.
-
Men tell me how difficult it is to express their needs. How they have been taught that brave men have no needs, so they're willing to sacrifice their lives for the king or for the flag.
-
In our training, we suggest to be sure that you learn how to be honest without any criticism without any blame, without any judgment of a kind where people hear that what they're doing is bad or wrong.
-
Many people get very confused and upset with it. Their whole lives have been based on the language of good, bad, right, wrong. They see it's all about how you are judged by authority. If you're judged, right, you get rewarded, and bad, you get punished.
-
I was not suggesting that we not judge or evaluate people's behavior. I was suggesting that we not judge them in a way that perpetuates retributive justice, based on the concept of punishment and reward.
-
We suggest that everyone have at least a vocabulary of nine human needs. I picked the number nine after reading a research done by Manfred Max neef, an economist from Chile. His whole system of economics is based on human needs.
-
In the United States, we measure the success of the measurements of the GNP, the gross national product, which essentially is how much money is made in certain areas. That system shows that it's successful when the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.
-
Manfred Max-Neef approach to economic success is based on whether human needs are met by all of the parties in the culture. Since his whole system of economy is based on human needs, he's gone to some trouble to research what are the basic human needs
-
Max-Neef classifies the fundamental human needs as: subsistence, protection, affection, understanding, participation, recreation (in the sense of leisure, time to reflect, or idleness), creation, identity and freedom.
-
Anytime we find ourselves wanting to criticize, when we translate that criticism into our needs that isn't being met, we are far more likely to get our needs met, when we speak our needs than when we tell people what's wrong with them.
-
After we have made clear expressions of what's alive in us, namely what we're observing, what we're feeling, what we're needing, if our need is not getting met, then we need to end on a clear request.
-
In nonviolent communication, we tell people what we do want, rather than what we don't want.
-
In nonviolent communication when we've expressed a need that isn't met, we end on a clear request of what we want back at this moment. The request needs to be an action language.
-
If people hear demands, it takes much of the joy away from doing anything. It's much more likely to provoke resistance than cooperation.
-
With many people, this is very hard to get them to trust that our requests are requests and not demands to whatever degree people carry memories, that when they don't do what other people want they have been criticized, guilted, blamed, punished.
-
In nonviolent communication, we say what is alive in us: what we're observing, feeling, and needing. We make clear requests, presented, as best we can, in a way that people can trust it is a request and not a demand.
-
When somebody requests something of you, to say no in nonviolent communication, we begin by showing that we receive the other person's request as a gift.
-
Be aware that "no" is a poor expression of a need. Anytime a person says no, they're basically saying I have a need that keeps me from wanting to do what you have requested at this moment.
-
To say no in a nonviolent communication way. We say the need that keeps us from saying yes.
-
When saying no in a nonviolent communication way, end on a request that searches for a way to get everybody's needs met.
-
Saying no in a nonviolent communication way: Show an empathic reception of the request of the other person. We don't say "no", we say the need that keeps us from saying yes. We end with a request that searches for a way to get everybody's needs met.
-
One reason people use more words than anybody wants to hear is that the speaker is not conscious of what they want back. They don't understand what their own present request is, and so they keep going on and on, when they're not even too sure what they want in the conversation.
-
My prediction is, the more conscious you are what you want back in the form of what you're requesting of your listener, you use fewer words and get more understanding.
-
The father said, OK, Marshall, I think I'm seeing what you're trying to help us to see. I said, What's that? I see now what I want him to do, to meet my need for respect. I said, What's that? I want him to jump when I say jump, and smile because he feels like jumping.
-
The father could see that when he said, "I want you to respect me", he really wanted obedience. He could see, then, why the son reacted so negatively when he would ask for things.
-
Research shows that different people have quite different requests to get their need for love met. What will meet one person's need for love doesn't necessarily meet another's need for love.
-
She said, Okay, Marshall, I got your point. I see what's going on. I see why I'm not getting my need for love met. Why is that? What do you want him to do to meet your need for love? I want him to guess what I want before I know what it is, and I want him always to do it
-
Many of us carry around very destructive strategies for getting our basic needs met. Strategies that are destructive, first of all, because they're not possible, or secondly because they deny the needs of the other person, and require the other person be subservient to us.
-
Some people use the word love as a feeling. Nonviolent communication suggests that we use the word love solely as a need and not as a feeling. If we're trying to express emotions, then use other words beside love for describing what we are feeling.
-
Another thing that's very important when expressing our needs in a nonviolent communication way is not to get our needs confused with strategies for getting the needs met.
-
Needs are universal. All human beings have the same needs. The second thing that differentiates a need from a strategy, a need contains no reference to specific actions. Anytime we say "I want you to" that's not an need, that's a request or a strategy.
-
Another thing that's very important when we do express clear request, is to make sure that we are not addicted to getting what we want.
-
If your intent is to get people to do what you want, that's a different intent than we need to have. In nonviolent communication, it's never our objective to get what we want. It's to create the quality of connection with people that ends with everybody getting their needs met.
-
Everyone's needs getting met is the objective of nonviolent communication. This doesn't require ever giving up or giving in, it just means not getting addicted to our strategy.
-
If we're addicted to our strategy, it's very easy for the other person to hear a request as a demand, this threatens their need for autonomy, and makes it harder for them to enjoy giving.
-
We need to say clearly what we want. But the objective is to create a connection and then which everybody's needs get met through compassionate giving.
-
State the observations that are leading you to feel the need to say something. These should be purely factual observations, with no component of judgment or evaluation.
-
State the feeling that the observation is triggering in you, or guess what the other person is feeling, and ask. Naming the emotion, without moral judgment, enables you to connect in a spirit of mutual respect and cooperation.
-
State the need that is the cause of the feeling, or guess the need that caused the feeling in the other person, and ask. Tuning into the feeling, you can often find the underlying need.
-
Stating the need, without morally judging, gives clarity about what's alive in you or the other person in that moment.
-
Make a concrete request for action to meet the need just identified. Ask clearly and specifically for what you want right now, rather than hinting or stating only what you don't want.
-
Imagine yourself getting up on a surfboard, this requires getting in touch with a certain energy. If you don't get on exactly, you can get knocked off. To me, empathy is somewhat like that. Empathy is getting in touch with the life energy that's coming through another person.
-
When people need empathy the most, they're often expressing it in a pretty violent way. In that sense, it's very much like surfboard riding. How to get in touch with this energy and flow with it?
-
The energy coming through people is, for me, a very beautiful divine energy. When I can really stay connected with it, I feel like I'm riding in a very precious flow of energy.
-
See me beautiful, look for the best in me. That's what I really am, and all I want to be. It may take some time, it may be hard to find, but see me beautiful.
-
See me beautiful, each and every day. Could you take a chance, could you find a way, to see me shining through every thing I do and see me beautiful.
-
The most important part of empathy is the hardest. It involves our presence, our full presence to what is alive in this person, at this moment.
-
Martin Buber the Israeli philosopher and psychotherapist says that presence is the most powerful gift one person can give to another. A powerful gift and a precious gift. When we give this gift to others, this gift of our presence, it is a major component of healing.
-
If we start to think about what the person is saying, we lose this presence. All of the theories that we might bring into the present moment, about this person, will get in the way of our staying empathically connected.
-
At university, we're trained to analyze people what leads them to behave as they do. That kind of intellectual training and analysis, of what goes on historically that creates present problems, can get in the way of empathy.
-
One of the things that we need to stay clear about, is not to get mixed up intellectual understanding with empathy.
-
If a person starts to talk about some pain they're having, the other person might say, "I'm so sad that you're going through this suffering." That sadness and caring on the part of this person could probably be well received if the person in pain first received empathy.
-
When we are giving a sympathetic response, we're talking about ourselves. This takes the focus away from what is alive in the other person.
-
I have found that people can enjoy that sympathetic response too, once they have had the empathic connection that they need. But to confuse these two things can be very painful.
-
How do you tell somebody that when you tell me "how sad you are", and start to give me advice, I know you mean well, but it's not only not what I need, it actually stimulates more pain. It leaves me feeling more lonely with that pain.
-
Another thing we don't want to mix up is giving advice with empathy. Very often we think that we are showing understanding of people and we jump right in and start to give them advice.
-
We don't want to mix up empathy and sympathy.
-
In nonviolent communication as we'll see, we never say I understand. We do something far more powerful. We demonstrate understanding.
-
Empathy takes place in the now. If the other person is telling me about some things that happened to their life in the past that caused great pain in them, I put my focus on what is alive in them now when they're telling me this.
-
Empathy involves: presence; focus on the now; focus on feelings and needs. That means not on thoughts. Most people are used to talking about their thoughts.
-
Many of the thoughts that people make, especially those that judge others or themselves, are really tragic expressions of what they're feeling and needing at that moment.
-
When we are making empathic connections, if somebody tells us what they think about us, we don't hear that. We try never to hear what a person thinks about us. I really believe that if we learn how to hear the life behind these thoughts, will enjoy people more and live longer.
-
We go to the feelings and needs being distorted by the thoughts that criticize oneself or others. To do that will require some guessing, some sensing, of what the feelings and needs might be. Because the speaker is not directly saying, this means we'll be wrong some of the time.
-
We need to put into words what we sense the person might be feeling, and then we connect their feeling to what they might be needing. This means that we don't get addicted to being right. We want to connect, It's not a test that we have to get right.
-
In nonviolent communication, we never try to be perfect. We try to be progressively less stupid. We're conscious that anything that's worth doing is worth doing poorly.
-
When people are upset, even if they're being upset is stimulated by a misinterpretation on their part, it really helps if we can empathically connect, before correction.
-
I was trained to try to help people connect the present problems they're having with things that happened earlier in their life to get them insights into this. It took me quite a few years to realize how much more powerful it was for me to empathically connect with them, rather than to intellectually analyze how their problems began
-
When people trust that you value what's alive in them what they're feeling and needing at a given moment, that takes more precedence for you, than whether what they're saying is right or wrong this has a big impact on the relationship.
-
It makes compassionate connecting much easier when people really feel that what's alive in them is what matters to you.
-
When we empathically connect with a message that comes at us. It gets the person in touch with even more pain that they're experiencing. When we stay connected to that, they go even deeper.
-
If we stay with their present feelings and needs, that gets them in touch with other deeper feelings and needs that are also going on within them. Sometimes this can take quite a while before the person really feels fully understood.
-
A very important part of empathically connecting is to make sure we stay with the empathic connection, until the other person feels fully understood.
-
When a person receives empathy from another, not only does the person who receives it feel good, but it's highly likely that anyone observing this feels good. There is something very special when somebody in pain receives an empathic connection.
-
In our nonviolent communication training, we show people how to hear the human behind the no. To be conscious that, if we hear a no, we're hearing very little about what's really alive in this person at this moment.
-
We need to do the same thing with the no as we do if somebody is telling us what's wrong with us, to hear through the message to what is alive in the person when they say this.
-
I suggest to hear what is the person feeling and needing when they say that. We'll learn a lot about what's going on by doing that. We'll show the person we are more interested in the connection with them than in their immediately responding to our request.
-
That is a very powerful message when people trust that the connection is valued over their submission to whatever we are requesting.
-
To interrupt them when you have heard more words than you want to hear, and when the words are not really connecting you clearly to what is alive in the person. Say, "Excuse me" and then what we say is to bring the conversation back to life, back to what is alive in this person at this moment, behind all the words.
-
Here's where I might interrupt, but I would interrupt to try to connect to what's alive and then now, behind all these words. I might say excuse me, excuse me for interrupting but I really want to be sure I'm connecting to what you want me to hear by telling me this.
-
I was keeping a lot of myself hidden, because I was telling myself that I had to be afraid of what people might say to me. But then I started to realize I don't have to worry about what people say to me. I only have to worry about how I respond to that.
-
The things that I was most afraid of what people might say to me, if I was honest, I could see that I was afraid to reveal things about myself, for fear of getting that message back. For each one of them, I thought, "What might the stimulus be for the person to say that to me?"
-
For each item on the list then that I saw that I had been hiding parts of myself out of fear of somebody might saying this back to me. For every one of the messages, I practice sensing guessing what that person might be feeling and needing if they said that to me.
-
These things that I had been so afraid other people might say, how different it was, if I could just learn to hear the feelings and needs behind any message.
-
I don't have to worry about being honest with people and how they might respond. I only have to be prepared to empathically connect with whatever comes back. That means my power is in my hands. My security is in my hands. It's not in what other people think about me or say to me.
-
Words are windows or they're walls They sentence us or set us free When I speak and when I hear Let the love light shine through me - Ruth Bebermeyer and Marshall Rosenberg
-
Some people use the word love as a feeling and emotion. If they do that, it's pretty hard to know how to answer that question without reference to a specific time and place because feelings change every few seconds.
-
In nonviolent communication, we use the word love as a need, and a very important need. What's very important is to know how to manifest this need, to contribute to that need being met, in people that we care for, and that we have intimate relationships with.
-
When we have that ability to share that which is not easy to express, we get a chance to get these needs fulfilled. But if we are so frightened of expressing these needs that we don't say anything that creates barriers in the relationship.
-
The more I go on with this kind of apology for having the need and justifying it, the harder it is for the other person to give out of loving energy
-
It's very important is to develop a consciousness that our needs are precious gift if they are expressed in a way in which we are not demanding that the person meet our request, in relationship to our needs.
-
If the other person trusts that when we say our needs, and we follow with a request, that we only want them to do it, if they can do it willingly, joyfully. When we have this consciousness that our needs are a gift, we express them with a totally different energy
-
When we have this consciousness that our needs are a gift, we then express them with a totally different energy that makes it much easier for the other person to enjoy receiving our needs, and makes it much easier for them to respond out of the joy of giving.
-
Follow the need that isn't being met with a clear request. If we simply express the need without the request, it often leaves the other person in a position either of not being clear what we want, or with the idea that we expect them to know what we want them to do about it.
-
When I tricked myself into thinking I'm responsible for my partner's happiness, I'm taking on a job that I can't do. I can't make the other person happy.
-
I can only be responsible for my own actions, my own intentions. The other person is responsible for how they take what I do, how they interpret it, and what they do to get their needs met.
-
It's very important to see that we cannot be responsible for other people's happiness. We cannot be responsible for other people's actions. We are responsible for our own intentions and actions.
-
If somebody says 'no' to us, that can't make us feel bad, it's how we interpret the no. We lose this consciousness as we get educated so that interdependence is not what happens in intimate relationships, but co-dependence, where people take on responsibility for each other's happiness.
-
Many of the women I work with have a difficult time expressing their needs. They have internalized cultural programming that says that loving women have no needs. Ao demonstrate their love for others, they believe that you must suppress your needs in favor of the other person.
-
Men seemed to have real difficulty expressing their feelings, especially any feelings that imply vulnerability, like feeling hurt, or sad, or lonely. They are educated in what I call the John Wayne concept of masculinity and not supposed to have such vulnerable feelings.
-
Well, the first step in saying no, is to make empathic connection with the other person's needs. The empathic connection lets the other person know that we do care about their needs. We show that care by taking the time to stop and really connect with what's going on in them.
-
We start with this empathy for the other person's needs when we say no, and then we follow it with the need of ours that keeps us from willingly being able to do what they're asking of us at this moment.
-
To say no: We empathically connect with the other person's needs, silently or verbally. We say our need that keeps us from saying yes. We end on a request that searches for a way to get everybody's needs met.
-
If we're going to be good at expressing our needs, we want to be prepared to deal with somebody who gives us a diagnosis for having our needs.
-
How can I let you know what my needs are, and what I'm requesting of you, so that you can believe that I only want you to do it if you can do it joyfully, that it's not giving in or giving up?
-
This is very important to work out in intimate relationships, how each party can hear each other's needs when they are expressed in a way that they trust that the partner only wants them to give if it can be done willing.
-
Another problem that often makes it hard for people to enjoy giving in an intimate relationship is when their partner skips the need and just expresses their pain and goes immediately to a strategy.
-
When they hear the pain, and immediately the pain is followed by a request. Very often in my experience, that request is going to be heard as a demand.
-
It's very important when we are in a good deal of pain about something, that we be conscious, it's by making the need clear and our feelings clear, when people have that focus, then specific strategies that are requested have a whole different case to them.
-
We've got to be prepared, anytime we express ourselves vulnerably, we got to be prepared to empathically deal with what comes back.
-
Nonviolent communication suggests we really make sure that everything we're doing is done willingly, out of an energy that comes when we are enriching life, and it's meeting our need to enrich life, so that we never feel as though we are sacrificing ourself for the other people.
-
Many of the women that I work with find it very hard to hear their partner's needs without losing their own needs, other people's needs are more important to them.
-
There's a different energy when we are giving fully out of our own need to contribute to the other person's well being, that isn't mixed at all with this idea that it's our obligation or duty to care for the other person.
-
When we take responsibility for other people's feelings, rather than our own actions, that is when our giving is mixed. It doesn't contain the pure joy of giving that's necessary for relationships to be strengthened.
-
Respect for authority, as I use the term, is manifest when we know things that people don't know, or can do things that they don't know how to do. They see that these things are very valuable and they see that these things are being offered to them and not imposed upon them
-
Fear of authority is usually built into the structure of either the family, the school, the business, the government. This structure gives us the right to impose things on people. We can reward or punish, to get people to do what we want.
-
Respect for authority needs to be earned. We need to clearly communicate with people so they can see the value of what we're offering.
-
Obedience is maintained when people submit, because we have the power to either reward or punish. Willing cooperation only can be received when people feel free from this kind of coercion, and they trust that their needs as human beings are valued.
-
When we're in positions of authority, we want people to do things because they choose to do it, because they see how it will enrich their lives and the lives of others to do it. That requires a radically different exercise of authority than many of us know how to do.
-
To use punishment and reward to get people to do things is very costly for the organization and for the relationships of people within the organization.
-
I used to try to figure out what can I do so that the students will see me as a human being offering them something that's valuable to me, that I hope will be valuable to them. How can we create that quality of connection?
-
When we are in this position of authority called parent, if we don't watch out, we allow our cultural training to lead us to treat this person we label as our child in a way that's far less respectful and caring than people we would label as our neighbors.
-
I would hope that we would show the quality of honesty where we revealed our own feelings and needs and request, not criticism and demands. Whether this person is 3 or 53
-
When we are in these positions labeled authority, within families, within schools, within the business place, it's very easy if we don't watch out, to lose connection with our own humaneness and the humaneness of others, and see people as titles.
-
If we don't watch out, we give the institution the power to turn us into something other than what we are as a human being, we become the label
-
If we don't watch out, we give away our power to institutions to make monsters out of us.
-
Very often the institutions that we're in might not be set up to maintain the kind of values that we hold within ourselves. It's extremely important that we learn how not to give away our power to authority.
-
It's extremely important that we learn how not to give away our power to authority. That no matter how people might make demands of us when they are in positions of authority, we hear it as a request and never as a demand.
-
We don't give our power away to the authority to tell us what we are, we hear their humaneness behind their message.
-
One of the things that I find very important to prepare our children with is to show them how to maintain their own integrity, their own value system, even if they are going to be in structures that have different values than they have.
-
When I was a child, I had been educated to believe that teachers know what's right, and so within the school setting, I was giving away power to the authority. That wasn't good for me.
-
I believe everyone has a right to dance and sing even if they move and sound like a crow with a crippled wing.
-
It's important that we not be obedient to authority, that we always recognize our choice. It's also important to recognize that rebellion is only halfway to being fully free. If we're rebelling against authority, we're still recognizing its power over us.
-
No matter what structure I'm in, they may control the environment, but they can't control me. I'm free within any structure, to choose what I want to do, and why I want to do it.
-
I would hope that we help ourselves and others develop is a consciousness, no matter what the structure, that we not give away our values and succumb to what the structure tells us to do.
-
When we are in a position of authority, it is not the objective to control people. It is to offer people what we have to offer, from my position of authority, but not to impose it.
-
Carl Rogers said, I have the belief that the most important part of learning is to wonder: "what's worth learning?"
-
I would like us all to do some wondering and on the basis of this wondering, take actions that free us from authority and institutions that function in ways that are not conducive to our living the lives we choose to live.
-
I'd like us to wonder whether we have fully developed our ability to stay human, even when we're in the institutions that make it a challenge to stay human.
-
I'd like us to wonder whether we have learned to express our humanity, even when we are labeled in a way as superior or inferior.
-
I hope we are wondering whether we've fully developed our ability to see the humaneness of people in positions of authority, who aren't able to stay connected to their humaneness and who speak a language of domination and who use punitive tactics.
-
I'd like us to wonder whether we have fully developed our ability to see that person's humaneness, and that we can communicate with them and show them other ways of getting all needs met, beside the ways that we have been trained to use power within domination systems.
-
I'd like us all to learn how to use power with people, not power over people.
-
The concept of mental illness takes the focus away from what might be causing the problems, the structures and the education they require
-
Just to receive empathy for what is alive in us the pain that's alive in us that may have been stimulated years ago. That pain is still with us right now, when we get an empathic connection with that pain, that's a very powerful contribution to healing.
-
We all have this ability to learn how to listen empathically to one another, and to contribute to one another, transforming this pain.
-
When we get empathy for our pain, that exists as a result of what was stimulated by others, that contributes to healing.
-
When we can empathically connect, with what was going on in the person who stimulated our pain, that contributes to healing.
-
Healing takes place when a person in pain both gets empathy for the pain that they're experiencing, and is able to give empathy to the person who stimulated the pain
-
Healing can take place if I empathically connect with people myself, playing the role of the person who stimulated the pain.
-
I want to be sure I'm hearing you.
-
I think we can heal from this situation, if you can tell me what's alive in you now, as a result of what happened in the past
-
In nonviolent communication, what is alive in you now is "what are you feeling?" and "what are you needing?"
-
I've asked people what their needs are, but they don't tell me their needs. They're very literate telling me what they think about themselves, in a way that implies there is something wrong with them. That's the kind of thinking I believe contributes to depression.
-
These judgments that we make of ourselves that stimulate depression are simply expressions of unmet needs
-
We haven't been educated to think in terms of what's alive in us, what we're feeling and needing. We've been educated to think of what we are.
-
If we can recognize these thoughts when we're having them and translate them into unmet needs, we live in a different world
-
If you want to know how to get really depressed in life, have children and think there is such a thing as a good parent
-
Parenting, this precious opportunity to bring people into the world and prepare them for the world... it's a precious job, but if we have been educated to think of ourself in a moralistic\judgmental way, we can take that job and turn it into something miserable
-
All of those judgments are really valuable messages – if we hear the truth – that what they're really trying to say is a need of mine is not getting met by what I'm doing
-
Help people to become conscious that these judgments they're telling themselves, that create misery, contain valuable information if we can hear the needs that are not getting met.
-
I predict that will resolve the conflict within 20 minutes from the point at which each party can tell me what the other party's needs are.
-
What I mean by a need contains no reference to specific strategies of what we want people to do or not do.
-
Nonviolent communication provides us with skills for clearly expressing our needs without criticizing the other person
-
All judgments and criticisms of others are tragic expressions of our needs
-
How amazing it is that long standing conflicts can be resolved fairly easily, when we get past the enemy images and can just get people to see the humaneness of both sides.
-
I'm confident we can resolve the conflict without further violence when both sides can clearly express their needs, and be heard by the other side.
-
This is where I think violence is provoked on our planet, when we educate people to think in terms of wrongness of one another, not to think a language of life, to clarify what our needs are and to hear other people's needs.
-
The conflict is never at the need level. The conflict is in the thinking of both sides, it turns the other side into an enemy. That thinking is in terms of strategies for meeting one's own needs and not the other person's needs.
-
It took about an hour just to get both sides to express a need and to hear the other side's needs. At that point, one of the chiefs who hadn't spoken yet said to me, Marshall, if we know how to communicate this way, we don't have to kill each other.
-
Our enemy images of one another get in the way of our connecting at the need level
-
And when we see we can never win at someone else's expense.
-
I'm convinced we don't have to have violence if we can learn how to connect with each other's needs.
-
We all have the same human needs
-
If we are skilled at nonviolent communication we can loan our nonviolent communication skills, we can loan our empathy skills by helping each side translate their criticism or judgments of the other into their needs, and then helping the other side to hear it.
-
If we have the ability to empathically connect with what people's needs are behind judgmental messages they make of the other side, we can be of great support in reconciliation and creating harmony between the two sides
-
Reconciliation takes the form of helping empathic connection take place by helping people to identify what their needs are, that are not being met, and how to express them without putting it in the form of criticism.
-
Gangs that I'm worried about, some of them call themselves governments, some call themselves corporations – organizations of people that have a big impact over our lives, and are doing some things that I think contribute to great violence on the planet, and great suffering.
-
How can each of us develop our own power and use it to transform these organizations so that they serve rather than threaten life? This can be quite a challenge because the spirituality, language, and means of influence these gangs perpetuate make it very hard for us.
-
The organizations that are doing the most damage on our planet can be quite a task for us to think of how we, as individuals, can change them. We are often overwhelmed just with our own personal lives, and trying to get our needs of our family met.
-
Nonviolent Communication helps us to differentiate between objectives which are to undo the damage created by the systems, but to recognize how different that is than changing the systems that create the problem.
-
Do we want to just heal the people hurt by these structures? Or do we want to radically transform the structures?
-
We can use Nonviolent Communication to go upstream and to connect with the people who are creating and supporting the structures that do the violence, and use Nonviolent Communication to show them other ways of serving other than those which are oppressing people.
-
One way that Nonviolent Communication support us, is to help us to look inside and see how do I want to meet this important need of mine, to serve life?
-
We can use our Nonviolent Communication consciousness and skills to conduct with the people creating the damage and positively compassionately influencing them to transform the structure so that they serve life for all rather than oppress people.
-
Social change involves the transformation of consciousness, people seeing other ways of doing things that they choose to do.
-
If we want to bring about social change nonviolently, we want the change to occur because a critical mass of people willingly shift what they're doing, from one position to another.
-
Whether we use force with our children, or with organizations, we want to be sure that it's the protective use of force and not the punitive use of force.
-
When we use the protective use of force, we don't see the other person as evil or bad and deserving of punishment. Our focus is on how we can stop what is creating the damage without being violent in the process
-
Our thinking is focused on how we would like to protect life.
-
We met and looked at what actions could we take that would protect the children and help us create the connection with those who are doing the damage, so that we could have a dialogue with them, and come out with a way that would meet everybody's needs.
-
I showed them that I thought it would be more effective if we created signs that purely communicated our needs and our intent, but in no way implied that we saw the people at the school as evil or bad.
-
As defined by Joanna Macy, despair work helps us to deal with the pain that we're feeling as a result of what is happening, out of our feeling of powerlessness to do anything about it.
-
Transformative Spirituality is when we are energized by our consciousness of how life can be better served in another way. We come out with joy and pleasure at the image of how it can be, rather than motivated by anger and bitterness toward people creating structures that harm
-
We need a spirituality that not only helps us to transcend our bitterness and our anger, but integrated with a real consciousness of what is happening that's creating the violence. Not just hope that by purifying ourselves the energy coming from us will create the change.
-
A real consciousness of what is happening that's creating the violence mobilizes us to create change, not just hope that by purifying ourselves the energy coming from us will create change.
-
One of my social change objectives for the last several years has been to do what I can do to contribute to transforming our judicial system from one based on the concept of retributive justice to one based on restorative justice.
-
Our present judicial system, retributive justice, comes out of a spirituality I'm very concerned about, that I feel does great violence on our planet.
-
I'm talking about the kind of spirituality, based on the concept that there are superiors who know what is right, and who on the basis of their judgments have the right to punish or reward people.
-
Our judicial system is based on this way of thinking that there are people who know what's right and what's wrong, and who therefore have the right to punish people
-
The concept that I'm interested in supporting is, Restorative Justice which is based on an entirely different way of thinking and leads to entirely different ways of exercising justice.
-
 RestorativeJustice has as its purpose, to find ways of getting everyone's needs met so that peace and harmony can be retrieved when pain and conflict exists between parties.
 -
 We want to restore the situation by replacing whatever education led to this person behaving as they did with an education that supports their contributing to people's well being, rather than doing things which create suffering for people.
-
There's the person who's been affected by the crime. A second party is the person who acted in a way that created pain for others. The third party involved in restorative justice is the community that provided the education that contributed to the person's crime.
-
We need to look at why is it that some people get their needs met by robbing, raping, and doing other things that cause great suffering.
-
The old spirituality says such people are evil and deserving to be punished and suffer for their actions. The spirituality of restorative justice says that these people are meeting their needs in the way they have been educated to meet their needs.
-
We want to restore the situation by replacing whatever education led to this person behaving as they did is now replaced with an education that supports their contributing to people's well being, rather than doing things which create suffering for people.
-
What do we need to do to support this person learning a different way? Look at how we are educating people, and make sure we are educating people to see that our well being is one in the same, That we can never meet our own needs at other people's expense.
-
Many cultures throughout the world have historically used restorative justice and still do.
-
In these cultures that see justice in a radically different way, whose spirituality does not believe that people are evil, or good. It's believed that, when functioning in harmony with our nature, we all enjoy, more than anything else contributing to one another's well being.
-
What we need, to restore peace and harmony, is to reconnect people with a conciousness that will help them naturally enjoy contributing to people's well being, rather than to act in ways that are harmful to people.
-
This process Nonviolent Communication has great power to enrich our lives, when it is our intention to create the connections necessary for compassionate giving to take place.
-
It's a process that helps us to share that information with others, how to be honest and share what's alive in us – in a way that enables others to enjoy compassionately giving to us.
-
A very important component in keeping this consciousness alive is the process of expressing gratitude to one another in a way that can be trusted that it's a celebration of life, and not a form of communication that's designed to manipulate us to do things that others want.
-
I mean that we let people know how our needs have been fulfilled, and how our life has been enriched by something they have done. Our only intention is to celebrate that, and not in any way to put them under pressure to continue doing that which we would like them to do.
-
Gratitude in NVC: We tell them what they have done, that has enriched our life. (Observation) - We express how it has, by letting them know the need of ours that was fulfilled by the action (Needs) - How we feel as a result of that need being fulfilled. (Feelings)
-
When we express gratitude, we use the same ingredients of clear observation, expressions of feelings and needs.
-
Now we're talking about actions that have contributed to our well being and needs that have been fulfilled, and the pleasureful things that follow these needs having been fulfilled.
-
Nonviolent Communication is clear on observations, feelings, and needs.
-
It's extremely important that we build into our lives, opportunities to exchange sincere gratitude, that we have opportunities to express it to others and to receive it.
-
Every time we receive sincere gratitude, it helps us to remember how good it feels to contribute to the well being of human beings. How good it feels to contribute to our own well being and the well being of others. How good it feels to celebrate that!
-
When we express gratitude in a Nonviolent Communication way: make it clear to the other person what they did that enriched your life; how you feel right now, when you think about that; what need of yours was fulfilled.
-
It has been my experience that there is nothing more fulfilling for human beings than when they exercise this power to enrich life and get confirmation that they have done so they can really experience how their efforts have enriched other people's lives.
-
What can feel better than using this power we have to enrich life, in the service of life, and seeing how our efforts have made life more wonderful for people?
-
Our ability to express gratitude well, is highly correlated with how well we're able to express our pain, and receive empathy for our pain, and transform the pain.
-
What gratitude might I have within me that I haven't expressed yet, that I would hate not to express?
-
One day a man named Jesus came around to my grandmother's door. He asked for a little food, she gave him more. He said he was Jesus the Lord; she didn't check him out with Rome. He stayed for several years, as did many without a home.
-
I went to the people that I didn't express my gratitude to, because I assumed that they knew it, and I asked them: Did you know? And half of them did and half of them didn't. But even the ones who did know still told me they would have liked to have heard it.
-
It's not only important to express gratitude, it's also very important to receive it well.
-
Just as it's hard for us to express gratitude, if we have this thinking of obligation, duty, and that's why you do things and that's all that's necessary.
-
That means we often don't express gratitude, thinking it's the other person's duty and obligation, they shouldn't need any gratitude for it.
-
It is our light, not our darkness, that scares us the most. - A Course in Mirales
-
When we have been living under a domination culture, where we are rewarded and punished by authorities told to do things out of duty and obligation, it's hard within that structure to really feel that we are created out of divine energy.
-
I know you can't give me me, no matter what you do. All I ever want from you, is you. -Ruth Bebermeyer
-
I want to be sure that gratitude that I have for others is expressed, and I want to make sure that gratitude others expressed to me is received.
-
My wife and I take time every mourning before we go off into the world to stop and express openly what the other has done that has enriched our life, and to tell them as best we can, how it enriched our lives.
-
We found that when we take that much time to stop and slow down and celebrate what's being done, how it's enriching our lives, we find that even then when we get into the hard stuff, it is so much more productive.
-
We begin to feel this bliss when messages previously experienced as critical or blaming begin to be seen for the gifts they are: opportunities to give to people who are in pain.
-
Peace requires something far more difficult than revenge or merely turning the other cheek; it requires empathizing with the fears and unmet needs that provide the impetus for people to attack each other. -
-
My theory is that we get depressed because we're not getting what we want, and we're not getting what we want because we have never been taught to get what we want. Instead, we've been taught to be good little boys and girls and good mothers and fathers.
-
If I seemed to put you down, If you felt I didn't care, Try to listen through my words, To the feelings that we share. --Ruth Bebermeyer
-
The more we practice in this way, the more we realize a simple truth: behind all those messages we've allowed ourselves to be intimidated by are just individuals with unmet needs appealing to us to contribute to their well-being.
-
The more people are trained to think in terms of moralistic judgments that imply wrongness and badness, the more they are being trained to look outside themselves-to outside authorities-for the definition of what constitutes right.
-
When we simply express our feelings, it may not be clear to the listener what we want them to do. Even more often, we are simply not conscious of what we are requesting when we speak. 
-
The more we empathize with what leads them to behave in the ways that are not meeting our needs, the more likely it is that they will be able to reciprocate afterwards.
-
The clearer we are on what we want back from the other person, the more likely it is that our needs will be met.
-
My anger wasn't coming from my fellow passenger nor the statement he had just made. His comment had triggered off a volcano inside of me, but I knew my anger and profound fear came from a far deeper source than those words he had just uttered.
-
My intention was to connect with him and show a respectful empathy for the life energy in him that was behind the comment. My experience told me that if I could empathize, then he would be able to hear me in return. It would not be easy, but he would be able to.
-
I've learned to savor life much more by only hearing what's going on in their hearts and not getting caught up with the stuff in their heads.
-
I intended to slow down the conversation, because in my experience, to whatever degree people hear blame, they have failed to hear our pain.
-
If this man said "Those were terrible things for me to say; those were racist remarks I made" he would not have heard my pain. As soon as people think that they have done something wrong, they will not be fully apprehending our pain.
-
if I ask the other person something about what they've just said, and I am met with "That's a stupid question," I hear them expressing a need in the form of a judgment of me, and proceed to guess what that need might be
-
This is our work: learning to recognize the need in statements that don't overtly express any need.
-
It is self-defeating to express our needs by interpreting or diagnosing their behavior. The more directly we can connect our feelings to our own needs, the easier it is for others to respond to us compassionately
-
If we hear the need behind a "no," we can continue the conflict resolution process–maintaining our focus on finding a way to meet everybody's needs–even if the other party says "no" to the particular strategy we presented them.
-
Hearing all three pieces of information – what I did, how she felt, and what needs of hers were fulfilled – I could then celebrate the appreciation with her.
-
...and ask ourselves, "What unmet need of mine is being expressed through this moralistic judgment?" When we do connect to the need-and there may be several layers of needs-we will notice a remarkable shift in our bodies.
-
Anger is a result of life-alienating thinking that is disconnected from needs. It indicates that we have moved up to our head to analyze and judge somebody rather than focus on which of our needs are not getting met.
-
This may take extensive practice, whereby over and over again, we consciously replace the phrase "I am angry because they ... " with "I am angry because I am needing ... " Use anger as a wake-up call"
-
it is self-defeating to express our needs by interpreting or diagnosing their behavior. Instead, the more directly we can connect our feelings to our own needs, the easier it is for others to respond to us compassionately.
-
"It's kind of awkward, but if I were to be precise, I guess what I want is for you to smile and say that anything I do is okay." Often, the use of vague and abstract language can mask oppressive interpersonal games.
-
every living situation has, like a newborn child, a new face that has never been before and will never come again. It demands of you a reaction that cannot be prepared beforehand. It demands nothing of what is past. It demands presence, responsibility; it demands you-Martin Buber
-
we easily trick ourselves into believing that life consists of doing things for reward; we are addicted to getting a smile, a pat on the back, and people's verbal judgments that we are a "good person"
-
The horrors that we have seen, the still greater horrors we shall presently see, are not signs that rebels, insubordinate, untamable men are increasing [...] throughout the world, but rather that there is a constant increase in the number of obedient, docile men. -George Bernanos
-
When we are in contact with our feelings and needs, we humans no longer make good slaves and underlings.
-
Whenever people feel that they're not free to choose what they want to do, they are likely to resist, even if they see the purpose in what we are asking and would ordinarily want to do it. - Living Nonviolent Communication
-
If we change ourselves we can change the world, and changing ourselves begins with changing our language and methods of communication. -Arun Gandhi (Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life)
-
Marshall answers "in your 40 years of mediating conflicts between warring factions around the world what's the most important thing that you do that creates peace between the people involved?"
-
I'll be having you try it out as we go along, so think of somebody that you have a conflict with. Write down what you would say to this person if you were to be honest about what they do that you don't like
-
"the purpose of this process is to help us to connect in a way that makes natural giving possible"
-
I started from the question of why some people enjoy other peoples suffering so that it makes violence enjoyable, so that people find it heroic to punish people that they judge as bad in them?
-
the only thing giraffe consciousness truly cares about is connection. it doesn't care about who's right who's wrong. a giraffe speaker wants to stay connected to the other person and that has profound ramifications.
-
Every action we take, we need to evaluate whether it meets our needs or not. If I cook a meal for myself I need to evaluate did that meet my need for nurturing, taste, and so forth. If it didn't then I want to change that!
-
One of the most dangerous languages in the world is to teach a child "You have to do something.", "There are some things you just have to do."
-
Anger, Depression, Guilt and Shame. Those feelings are very valuable. They tell us that at this moment I'm not directly connected to my needs
-
Words are windows, or they're walls, They sentence us, or set us free. When I speak and when I hear, Let the love light shine through me.
-
The problem is that whenever we are the most triggered about something we have a tendency to communicate in the exact way that will guarantee that we won't get our needs met.
-
If you don't know how to communicate in such a way as to get your needs met you're gonna be pretty unhappy.
-
While studying factors that affect our ability to stay compassionate I was struck by the crucial role of language and our use of words. I have since identified a specific approach to communicating, speaking and listening that leads us to give from the heart
-
Making life wonderful is the most fun game I've ever heard. Instead much of the time we play another game called who's right. Have you ever played that game? It's a game where everybody loses.
-
In nonviolent communication we evaluate from the heart. We make need serving judgments. We judge whether what people are doing is meeting needs or not. We don't moralistically judge the person for what they did, we judge whether it's serving life or not.
-
Not only to train people to be more compassionate to themselves and to be able to connect with others in a compassionate way, but to transform whatever structures are making it difficult to relate in a compassionate way
-
With this technology it will be impossible for you to hear criticism harsh remarks insults. With these ears all you can hear is the only thing human beings are ever saying: please and thank you.
-
Part of our training is to help people see a difference between needs and strategies. Strategies are ways of getting needs met. Some people think that profits, financial gain, is a need. No, it's a strategy that might or might not meet certain needs.
-
We have enough food so it isnt necessary for millions to starve. We have medicines that could be preventing millions from dying of diseases. Its only consciousness that we need to alter, and there is rapid movement toward the evolution of this consciousness
-
You want to say to yourself, "I want to learn to enjoy your pain"
-
I can never remember learning anything valuable by someone telling me what I am
-
When she hears your needs without hearing any criticism or demand, and you hear her needs without any criticism and demand, the solution will find you. The conflict will resolve itself
-
we're going to show you how the process works by showing you how to communicate with a person about one specific thing they do
-
I can't think of a more natural way to communicate than to talk about what's alive in us just what we're feeling and needing.
-
Never hear the thoughts that people have of you. Use the thoughts as a window, look through the thoughts to the needs that are behind, it'll be a whole different world.
-
If you had giraffe ears on, you wouldn't have heard me saying no you would have said What does Marshall need that's keeping him from saying yes? You might have said, Marshall are you having a need for completion of other things you'd like to do right now?
-
I had in my consciousness as a boy growing up to learn about why do some people respond compassionately to others and why are others so violent?
-
From the time they were two years old they educated me that I couldn't make them do anything. All I could do is make them wish they had. Then they taught me another lesson, they would make me wish I hadn't made them wish they had.
-
I couldn't make them do anything, all I could do is make them wish they had, and then they would make me wish I hadn't made them wish they had. They taught me that violence creates violence
-
When I speak and when I hear let the love light shine through me.
-
I had to see the human being behind the names that he was calling me.
-
Each of us is a powerhouse. We have words with the power to contribute to making people's lives more wonderful
-
The place that Nonviolent Communication helps us to live is quite a different world than this world of right doing and wrongdoing in which we decide whether the person deserves to suffer or deserves to be rewarded in the world
-
