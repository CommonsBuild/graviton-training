### Empathy is Key

Empathy is necessary to be able to apply certain principles of negotiation, as: 
* Separate people from problems 
* Ease communication between conflicting parties
* Focus in interest and not in positions 
* Generate variety of alternative paths to propose solutions
* Use objective or “credibly neutral” criteria to generate legitimacy and impartiality
Empathy brings us together and helps us to take rational and pacific decisions, because individuals who feels underappreciated or ignored are more prone to fall in irrationality just to defend themselves.

### Ethical Standards and requirements for Gravitons

* **Voluntary Process**: All members in the Gravity group participate without coercion from any actor.
* **Self-Determination**: Recognize the ability to promote voluntary agreements. The mediator facilitates the management of disputes but the outcomes belong to the parties.
* **Conflict of interest**: Recognize when they are not capable of facilitating a conversation for any possible reason, personal or professional.
* **Competence**: As we are a community of experts, the mediator, besides being trained in Alternative Dispute Resolution, should be able to prove deep understanding of the specific topics that the dispute may be about.
* **Confidentiality**: Information related to these processes should be handled privately, and strategically shared only with the agreement by the parties. Unwanted information filtered by the mediator is a reason to remove from the Gravity group.
* **Impartiality and neutrality**: The Gravity group members should lead by their example of empathy and acceptance of different points of view, with freedom from favouritism.
* **Professional Responsibility**: Gravity members should assume the task of mediating in the organization with diplomacy and prudence.
* **Rotation**: Three times a year, new training and selection processes will be run to encourage members of the community to become part of the Gravity team. One can only be in this group for three years in a row, to avoid accumulation of power.

## Steps for a mediation process

1. **Planning**: Before the mediation process begins, the mediator helps the parties decide the communication mechanics, introduces the participants, outlines the mediation process, ams and **observate** with them who should be present in the process.
2. **Introduction**: With the parties gathered together, the mnd lays out ground rules. And presents the goal for the mediation process: to help the parties come to the Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement (BATNA).
3. **Opening remarks**: Following the mediator’s introduction, each side has the opportunity to present its view of the dispute without interruption. In addition to describing the issues they believe are at stake, they may also take time to express their **feelings**.
4. **Joint discussion**: After each side presents its remarks, the mediator and the disputants ask questions with the goal of arriving at a better understanding of each party’s **needs** and concerns. If parties reach an impasse, mediators diagnose the obstacles and work to get the discussion back on track.
5. **Caucuses**: If emotions run high during a joint session, the mediator might split the two sides into separate rooms for private meetings, or caucuses.
6. **Negotiation**. At this point, it’s time to begin formulating ideas and **requests** that meet each party’s core interests. The mediator can lead with all parties in the same room, or can engage in “shuttle diplomacy,” moving back and forth between the teams, gathering ideas, proposals, and counterproposals.

(00:13:03)
**Juan Carlos**:    With that, I pass to some of the steps of mediation process. As I was saying before, as there are many ADR techniques, there are also many frameworks or that steps for mediation process or for reconciliation process, or for acting as a third part. 

Some of them have three steps that are like cycling, cycling, and post cycling. That that is the cycle of justice circles. Some of them have four steps like non-violent communication. Some of them have six, six steps, so this framework is not fixed. 

It's not like it doesn't matter so much how many steps they are, but what is the process that they are trying to show and the process and with the steps that I am mentioning here that are sick, basically starts with planning. 

Before the mediation process begins, the mediator has to help the parties decide what communication mechanisms that they are going to have, how, how it's going to be their, the communication, if they're going to communicate one another directly, or if they are going to have the third part acting like as a person who has to approach one each of them individually, and then communicate the intentions of the other.  

Basically that relates a lot to observation to knowing who should be present in the process, who are the important stakeholders in the process, and who should, who are the person that also should not be like too much involved in the conflict. 

Then we go to an introduction that is when the parties are gathered together, the mediators should introduce the participants, the process, and should outline how are they going to be working and how are they going to be addressing this issue? 

Having this formal acceptance on the process, because the goal of the mediation process is to help the parties, to have the best alternatives to a negotiated agreement. We are going to present to them our intentions to help them to get to an agreement. That is an introductory moment for a mediation process.  

When you start that mediation process, you will need to have this moment of opening remarks. This is best when it's done with the presence of both parties, because it's important for the other part to listen. 

It's also important for this to have like a previous process talking with the, with the, with each of this parts, asking them to try to explain their points of view without judgment, because if each of the, if the parts starts like talking about judgements, and then the other part start judging the other, and then the communication is broken. 

It's a task of the mediator to have the communication on track and to keep the communication nonviolent so that the dialogue can prosper and not turn into an antagonist process. In this moment, it's important for, for the parts involved and for the mediator to understand the feelings of the parts involved as we are seeing here, these four words are the key words of nonviolent communication. 

It's related to this process that we've been talking since the first session of observations, feelings, identifying the needs and making request, but framed into steps of the mediation process. When each of those parts like express their view of the disputes, then you can like map some of the feelings and some of the interest around the needs.  

Also the mediator has to ask questions what does the other person want, and how can they arrive to a better understanding for, for each one of the parties needs. If the parties reach any path, the mediator has to diagnose the obstacles and work to get the discussion back on track.

It is normal that when people is talking about a dispute, they like start scaling and then like the communication can be broken. At any moment, if they start like judging or having, or using a strong language, but the mediator has to diagnose these obstacles and try to have always the discussion back on track.  

In this step we have the caucuses. These small groups where you will have to communicate to all of the parts involved what are the benefits and what are the risks of each of the solutions that are proposed? I liked a lot what Ostrom said that we have to have ex-ante and exposed costs. 

We should have we should measure the costs of implementing at the decision, but also the costs of sustaining a decision. The idea is that we can like gather our willingness to put an agreement in place, and like trying to have like these communication between the collectives, so that they work with the decision that is being taken. 

Then we have the negotiation process that is when you start formulating ideas and request to meet each party score interest, and the mediator can read with all parties in the same room, or engage in such shuttle diplomacy. That is moving back and forth between the teams gathering ideas, proposal, and counter-proposals.  

This is a process that you have to understand that is like gathering information, understanding, mapping the conflict, helping to ease the situation, not like seeing, going through the branches of the conflict, but trying to see the root of the conflict, and then trying to make request that meet the expectations and the interest of the parties.  

## Window of Tolerance

![](https://i.imgur.com/kgV0xXj.png)

> Pat Ogden describes: we need to understand the window of tolerance so that we can better understand what is happening to us when we are experiencing distress.
> 
> Ask yourself when managing a situation, am I hypo-aroused or hyper-aroused?

This is why it's so important to go to the balcony. Because when you go to the balcony and you take this, you, you can change from a hyper-arousal to an optimum arousal. Also, this is something that a psychologist like talk about and is like the window of tolerance, and that we all have this window of tolerance where sometimes we are hyper aroused, or sometimes we're hypo aroused. 

We have to try to keep ourselves in the optimal arousal zone for managing conflict. Because as I said before, maybe you can spend months trying to get into an agreement. Then you come to a hyper arousal zone where you are emotional reactivity and and you have a disorganized cognitive process. 

You can take an irrational decision just because you were in a hyper arousal zone, or maybe you are in a hyper, hyper arousal zone, and you like numb your emotions, or you like de disable your cognitive processing, or you like need yourself from sensations.  

To manage a conflict, it's strategy to keep yourself in the optimal arousal zone and help to keep the parts in the optimal arousal zone. If you see that one of the parts is hyper aroused, maybe you can like listen to them and like take notes from what they are saying, but also to invite them to calm down a little bit. 

Then you can also talk to them later when they are more calm and you can see the difference between the statements that they make. Also when, when someone is like inhibiting to seeing the conflict, it is for the conflict manager to like show the conflict and to talk about some of the feelings that like maybe she or he is not like trying to feel so that they can calm again into their optimal arousal zone and be able to take a good decision.  

When we understand that window of tolerance, we understand is happening to us when we are experiencing distress. We can ask ourselves and ask the conflicting parties when managing a situation, am I hyper aroused or hyper aroused? Maybe you are angry about something and you are angering. 

You're angry, just take a bath. That would help you very easily to like calm yourself down. When, and after you take a bath, or after you take a run, or after you meditate, then you will have like another perspective of the conflict. That is why it's so important to go to the balcony. Each, each of us has different ways to go to the balcony. There, there are people like they like to have time alone, or there are people that like to sleep, or there are people that like to go out with friends.  

### Keeping a Calm Mind

> There are different rituals to manage your thoughts. The best decisions are always taken when you are in your [optimal arousal zone](https://worthit2bme.com/fightflightimmobolize/therapeutic-window-of-tolerance/). That is, Neither Hyper nor hypo aroused.
> 
> [Ho’oponopono](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAuWRuU4uzA) ([is a technique that works for me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brRYPC5y954)), but everyone can find the best way to return to its optimal arousal zone when being in distress. Meditation, exercise, walking, playing an instrument, game or sport, going out, sleeping, etc.
> 
> As Jill Bolte-Taylor's noted, the physiological lifespan of an emotion in the body and brain is 90 seconds. So we can control our emotions by the thoughts we trigger in our minds.

(00:33:39)
Those, all of those are mechanisms for keeping a calm mind. There are different rituals. Each of you have to recognize what are the rituals that one can like practice when, when they want to return to their optimal arousal. Also, and as I was talking before, there is meditation, there is playing video games. 

All those stuff is good, if you are using it to like calm yourself down, or maybe if you are hyper aroused, you can go make some exercise, or you can like talk with another person so that you can understand your own feelings. As Joe bolted, Taylor noted the physiological life of an emotion in the body and brain is 90 seconds. We can control our emotions by the thought with triggers, with trigger in our mind.  

That means if you're hyper aroused and you only keep thinking hyper aroused, you will only have hyper aroused thinking, and you will like keep yelling stuff at yourself or to the other person mentally. But if you go to the balcony, you are going to be able to change the lifespan of that emotion. 

This is a practice that I have shared here in the community that works for me, that is called [Ho’oponopono](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAuWRuU4uzA), but everyone can find the best way to return to optimal arousal. Also, you can see this video, it's really good. It takes like a minute, two minutes of your time. 

It's very easy because it shows that sometimes when, when we charge our memory, we don't let like things go through with our lives. It's good sometimes to let things go. When you let things go and you like calm your mind, then like life can go through yourself.  

I say, it's a technique that works for me because I practice it. Like when I, when I'm in distress, I try to close my mind and say, I'm sorry, forgive me. Thank you. I love you several times. After some of of minutes, I am calm again. 

I also like make these wristbands that I give to my friends. That reminds me also of these words when I see them in my, in my, in my, in my hands or in my friend hands. It's, you, you have to search what is the best technique for you to go to the balcony?  

![](https://i.imgur.com/uPuHVRO.png)

(00:36:48)
Now we are going the other base of our bridge. We have the balcony and we have the bridge, and now we have the third side and who is the third side. The third side can be outsiders and insiders, but the third side that we want to be as gravitons, we want to be insiders that bring the sides together. 

These insiders are the one that are trying to build a bridge and to be a good third side in a conflict. Sometimes you have to keep the communication confidential. That outsiders don't influence on the DEC on the conflict management process that is being held between the sides.  

That is the formula. That is the formula balcony bridge, and third side. The formula is like the way, not just to get to an agreement, but to sustain an agreement with a common mind, and also to have a third side that helps to build, to bring the parts together. Also the third side also helps to bring, as I was before, for the negotiation process that we had several countries being a third side amongst them. 

There was Norway and Cuba, and actually the peace negotiation process was held in Cuba. Cuba and Norway, where this third site that helped Colombia and to have this safe space, to have this dialogue, because if we had this dialogue in Colombia, some of the people that were from the far could have been or something, and this was like a neutral were both the government and both felt that they could have a dialogue in peace.  

Norway was also one of the, was also one of the third site that gave legitimacy to the, but I want to show that sometimes like an agreement, even though that it has like a balcony or a third site is very difficult to keep, because this is a new that says like countries that are third part or warranties from the peace agreement in Colombia, ask the government to reforce security, to leaders and people who left like the gorilla. 

Yes, Cova and Norway expressed their pupation for, for the growing number of murders of ex guerrillas and social leaders in the country. These third side are the people who try to mind the legitimacy of the agreement, because what happened? We made this agreement with the past president and now the new president said, okay, I don't like those agreements.  

How can we like make an agreement? And within our inner self try to not follow that agreement or by any internal change that the are those can argue to defend what the agrees that they, the parts themselves, they are not like complying to. That's why Norway and Cuba sent a letter to the Columbia government saying, saying we helped you to take these decisions and now you are not like making them. 

Please as we are like testimonies of those we can ask you to follow what you said, and we can say that you are not doing what you said you were gonna do. the third side is very important in a negotiation and in like managing a dispute and are going, be like third siders are going be these third siders who may approach the conflict, but with the intention of helping to build that bridge and to keep that like robust. So it doesn't break apart.  

### Being a good third party

* Be able to procure safe *spaces for each part to trust in the process and to open themselves* as a way to dive deeper on the issue and collect valuable information.
* Take into account the **feelings** of each part, as ignoring the feelings can prevent a dispute from being resolved. It may be the biggest issue in mediation.
* Feel comfortable with strong emotions. In fact, it has been suggested that an important part of becoming a third part is to *become sensitized to the feelings of others as well as self*.
* Be able to **map and clarify** the situation, helping parties to understand their own interest & risk. and explore all possibilities to conform a satisfactory agreement.
* Help to make informed decisions, pondering expected costs (ex-ante & ex-post) and expected benefits to a negotiated agreement.

(00:42:40)

What is being a good third party? To be supportive on the issue and collect valuable information. Also a good third part should take into account the feelings of each part. A third part should feel comfortable with strong emotions. In fact, it has been suggested that an important part of becoming a third part is to become sensitized to the feelings of others, as well as health. 

A good third part should be able to map and clarify the situation, helping the parties to understand their own interest and explore all the possible, all the possibilities to confirm as a agreement. Also a third part part can also help to make informance from their expected costs, unexpected benefits to a negotiated agreement. Any question until now, how are you feeling? How is the CLA how is the training going?

(00:44:20)
**Speaker 3**:    Just one thing this, just to kinda clarify, so this is more sort of formal structure that like NVC can work within and is a part of as like a component? 

(00:44:41)
**Juan Carlos**:    Yes. That is why we started with NVC in the first session, because NVC is like a pillar from which ADR alternative dispute solution is built. We cannot have alternative dispute solution without, without, without nonviolent communication. 

It's very important that through the whole process and to be able to formally help in the, in the search of solutions for conflict, it is very important to be able to apply non-violent communication and to also to understand conflict as something that can be transformative, rather some rather than something negative just by itself.  

### Empathy is the key

> Empathy is necessary to be able to apply certain principles of negotiation, as: 
> - Separate people from problems 
> - Ease communication between conflicting parties
> - Focus in interest and not in positions 
> - Generate variety of alternative paths to propose solutions
> - Use objective or “credibly neutral” criteria to generate legitimacy and impartiality
> Empathy brings us together and helps us to take rational and pacific decisions, because individuals who feels underappreciated or ignored are more prone to fall in irrationality just to defend themselves.

(00:45:43)
Empathy is the key empathy is the key to be a good third part. Empathy is the key to be a good mediator. Empathy is necessary to be able to apply certain principles of negotiation. Such as separate people from problems, ease communication between conflicting parties, focus in the interest and not in positions of the people generate variety of alternative paths to propose solutions and use incredibly neutral criteria to generate legitimacy and impartiality. 

Empathy is something that brings us together and help us to take rational and Pacific decisions because individuals who feel underappreciated or ignored are more prone to fall in irrationality just to defend themselves.  

So RA right now we went and we saw what is alternative dispute solution. We saw that the idea of graviton is to be able to provide mediation and conation to dos. That the idea is to build a bridge, but that, but to sustain that bridge with the third side, that the third side is going to be like rabbits. We are going to be this third side who can add legitimacy to the agreement. 

We are going to have this balcony that is to provide the calm state of mind, to can, to be able to sustain nonviolent communication and the, to sustain the review on the, on the price that we, that we can have as, as an agreement and to yes, to have a, a common state of mind to address the issue and to, and to sustain the negotiation.  

### Ethical Standards and requirements for Gravitons (1/2)

> **Voluntary Process**: All members in the Gravity group participate without coercion from any actor.
> **Self-Determination**: Recognize the ability to promote voluntary agreements. The mediator facilitates the management of disputes but the outcomes belong to the parties.
> **Conflict of interest**: Recognize when they are not capable of facilitating a conversation for any possible reason, personal or professional.
> **Competence**: As we are a community of experts, the mediator, besides being trained in Alternative Dispute Resolution, should be able to prove deep understanding of the specific topics that the dispute may be about.

(00:47:56)
**Juan Carlos**:    Now, I want to share with you, what are the ethical standards that are also requirements for the gravitons. All of you that have been attending to these trainings have received some poaps. If you have three or more poaps, then you can become the first generation of Gravitons that would like be able to be this third part, this to others. 

We will have standards that are requirements to join and to stay in the collective. That maybe we, you can have like your, your pop-ups, and you can become the first generation of Gravitant. But if you somehow violate one of these standards, then that is a reason for exclusion from the group. 

These are very important, and that is why I wanted to finish with this part of the, of this train, with telling this and that S and mediators have to understand, and the process of ADR as a voluntary process.  

It's a voluntary process, both from the graviton and also for the parts involved, the parts involved can go with this process as far as they feel comfortable, if they feel they're not comfortable with this, then the legitimacy of the grid that we are going to ease in doubt. 

That makes that the whole process more difficult. We have to understand that we cannot coerce people into managing their disputes through these mechanisms. This should be something voluntary and that, and then we should also respect self determination, and it's the ability to promote voluntary agreements. 

That outcome of the dispute belongs to the parties and not to the mediator and that each of the, those parties can self determinate and autonomously. That there is no like external coercion that, that the, that it are like putting pressure in the parts. Each part can like terminate autonomously.  

It's really important to recognize when there is conflict of interest. It would be normal, if a graviton says, I am not capable of facilitating a conversation in this moment because the parts are hyper aroused and maybe I will give some time to this issue. 

Maybe the conflict of interest that is happening right now can ease a little bit so that we can like have a conversation and a process of handling the dispute and also mediators and graviton should, should state competent and should be competent with the cases they are involved. 

As we are a community of experts, the mediator, besides being trained in alternative dispute solution should be able to prove deep understanding of the specific topics that the dispute may be about.

I am not like a, an smart contract expert. Maybe if the issue is very related to like a code or something, maybe I, even though I am an expert in alternative dispute resolution, maybe I will not be able to understand or to be competent in that case. 

It's really important for the graviton and to state competent competence on the issue, and to have like this professional responsibility with the role that if they feel that they are not capable of handling the issue or if they feel that other person would be better handling the issue, it's very much encouraged to say so. That helps the whole process.  

### Ethical Standards and requirements for Gravitons (2/2)

> **Confidentiality**: Information related to these processes should be handled privately, and strategically shared only with the agreement by the parties. Unwanted information filtered by the mediator is a reason to remove from the Gravity group.
> **Impartiality and neutrality**: The Gravity group members should lead by their example of empathy and acceptance of different points of view, with freedom from favouritism.
> **Professional Responsibility**: Gravity members should assume the task of mediating in the organization with diplomacy and prudence.
> **Rotation**: Three times a year, new training and selection processes will be run to encourage members of the community to become part of the Gravity team. One can only be in this group for three years in a row, to avoid accumulation of power.
> See more: https://forum.tecommons.org/t/gravity-role-design/174


(00:53:21)

This is another principle that is really important. It's confidentiality because in the information related to these processes should be handled privately and only strategically shared with the agreements of the parties, unwanted information filtered by the mediator is the reason to remove from the gravity group. 

We don't want people in the gravity group like to be people that make a cause for harm by using this information for personal interest or to yes, for personal interest. It's not good to handle this information publicly because we, that is a key for, for being able to build trust in the process.  

The idea here is not to expose anyone, but to help on reaching for solutions. Yes, confidentiality is something really also because with conflicts, they may say some things that because of their initial state of mind, of hyper arousal, they may something that does not reflect their point of beyond the conflict and that information could leave them like in a bad place to it really important for the graviton to be able to keep this information confidential. 

We as gravity will only like we will have a database where we keep will keep the registry of the conflict, but we will not keep sensitive information. We will only keep like the registry if there was an agreement. Gravitons should known by their example of empathy and acceptance of different point of view with freedom from favoritism.

This is another standard that is professional responsibility, mediation is a professional job, and it is something that should be done with diplomacy and prudence. with all the professionality that you could use in a normal job. 

It's not an informal process, this is something that is something that is going to be formal and kept for the wellbeing of different communities. The idea of the graviton as well, is to have this group of people have having a rotation where new trainings, this is the first training, but the idea is that we repeat this training once or twice a year, and that will encourage new members to become part part of the gravity team. 

When this is something that we have talked about, but it is something that still needs to be completely figured out. This the time that the maximum time that you can be in this group, because this rotation was, was said to avoid like centralization of power. 

Maybe if there is like a graviton who is in the gravitate group for like 10 years, maybe he has like too much information or too much power over the group. But the idea of this is to have a very relative group. What we initially said is after three years, you cannot like offer this anymore, but you can still like maintain in the group as a whole.

In the next sessions, we are going to go over practice over cases. But in the next sessions after that, I think it's the sixth session we're going to do a deep dive on how gravity like will work. 

With that, I think that I finished this first section of this, of this training that was to explain to you about negotiation, BATNA and dispute resolution. 

### d) [Rahman, Mediation and mediator skills: a critical appraisal](https://sci-hub.se/https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3231684)**

The realm of mediation has expanded dramatically. Since then, mediation has evolved from an alternative approach to conflict resolution for community activists to a process that has become part of our everyday landscape. Mediation-Skills and Techniques is an essential and comprehensive addition to the professional library of all mediators. The paper adopts an interdisciplinary approach to mediation, integrating knowledge and expertise from law, psychology, and sociology. It provides a time-tested, flexible model for effective mediation in diverse environments and situations. It also provides mediators and other professionals who use mediation such as lawyers, therapists, and personnel managers with comprehensive, step-by-step instruction in effective dispute resolution strategies and a clear overview of mediation and conflict, mediation process, the skills and approaches used by professional mediators.

### Keeping a calm mind

![](https://i.imgur.com/emeCju0.png)

There are different rituals to manage your thoughts. The best decisions are always taken when you are in your [optimal arousal zone](https://worthit2bme.com/fightflightimmobolize/therapeutic-window-of-tolerance/). That is, Neither Hyper nor hypo aroused.

[Ho’oponopono](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAuWRuU4uzA) ([is a technique that works for me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brRYPC5y954)), but everyone can find the best way to return to its optimal arousal zone when being in distress. Meditation, exercise, walking, playing an instrument, game or sport, going out, sleeping, etc.

As Jill Bolte-Taylor's noted, the physiological lifespan of an emotion in the body and brain is 90 seconds. So we can control our emotions by the thoughts we trigger in our minds.

* [Dealing anger effectively](https://satsang.arshavidya.org/wp-content/uploads/media/hhpsds/pdf/dealing_anger_effectively.pdf) Satsang with Swami Dayananda Saraswati and Arsha Vidya Gurukulam
  > Anger is nothing but an expression of pain and expectation. Çré Saìkaräcärya confirms this in his writings. We expect certain things to happen and there is an obstruction between what to happen and ourselves. In other words, between the desirer and desired, there is an obstruction blocking the fulfillment of what is desirable. Because of this obstruction, this desire is deflected. The deflected form of desire or expectation is called anger.
* [Anger Management & I Am NOT the Doer – Bhagavad Gītā Meaning (28)](https://www.yesvedanta.com/bg/lesson-28/)
  > Lesson 28 starts out by visually comparing Mind-Intellect-Ego of a samsari (life controlled by desires) – and of a self-actualized person (jīvanmuktaḥ). Then we correct common false notion of limiting Īśvara (God) to space-time. Finally, we discuss what it means to say “I am NOT the doer”. The real doer is Īśvara's laws-orders. This understanding is key to freedom.
