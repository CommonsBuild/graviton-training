* [The Orange Story](http://www.mediationtools.com/articles/smbj9605.html) By Lee Jay Berman
  > In our society, we are raised to think that when there is a conflict, one person has to win and the other has to lose. We are not accustomed to working out win-win solutions. It is harder to do. It requires more effort. The outcome, however, is worth it. By working together, cooperatively and collaboratively, we can come up with better solutions, whether in parenting, in employment settings, in business transactions or even in lawsuits.

**Deeper questions:**
- What do they want?
- What are their needs?
- What are their interests?

**Juan Carlos**:    I would like to present this first image that refers to a really basic source of conflict. This conflict is when we are in our own own points of view. We are not able to understand the other points of view. Sometimes reality is not one or another point of view. It's just a composition of both of them. 

A conflict is when two or more people like try to enforce a of reality that they think that is the whole truth. But what we are trying to talk about conflict is that this reveals us that there are no final truths and that we are all a addressing and connection of subjective points to that composes our reality. 

What is seen in a conflict is that participants push for their point of view, and what is not seen is why do they want the opinion to be heard? For conflict resolution, more than a final truth, **we need to understand the reasons why each one is attached to their position**. 

This is a very easy example of how communication can take us to a good agreement. There were two sisters fighting for an orange, and then the mom decided to split the orange in half, and she gave half of the orange to each one, but then she saw that one was squeezing the orange to make some juice. 

The other one just peeled some of the skin of the orange to bake a cake then threw the rest into the garbage. Conflict resolution is to understand ways of how can we take a better decision for both of the parties involved through communication. 

In the orange example, if the mom would have talked with their daughters she could have like given the fruit to one and the skin to the other, and everyone would be happy, but sometimes we just use these kind of prisoner dilemmas where, where they are fixed and they model our reality.  

> Sometimes we need to think out of the box and to see how communication can create opportunities that are not present in the first moment. 

For conflict resolution, we need to ask ourselves deeper questions. When we see a conflict is what do each of the participants and of the parties want in the conflict? What are their needs and what are their interests, maybe in this case to see nine benefits, more this person, and to see six benefits for this person. 

If they they talk, they can even benefit to say it's neither six or nine, or maybe if he talks with him, they can both say it's six. It's not a fixed situation, but through a dialogue you can come to a better state than the one that you started.

I don't want to scare you, but this is something that I am here to present that **conflict is everywhere**. When you study conflict, it's not that you are not gonna have any conflict in your life that are gonna be perfect. 

It's just that you are gonna be able to embrace, change and embrace conflict as something that is natural in life and embrace that things are not going to always happen as you want. that is an opportunity for you to understand, to improve, to learn, to become better, to innovate. 

Conflict is everywhere, but it's not like I'm gonna have a conflict just because, but we have to see conflict rather as a force, as a motor of change. As a dialectic process.

**Juan Carlos**:    OK. Yeah. We need to embrace conflict, embrace ourselves, embrace change, and treat ourselves with love and to talk to ourselves without judgment and applying what we learned from the first session that is to have nonviolent communication with others and with ourselves to embrace change and to embrace that nothing is going to be as we think in our minds. 

Reality is so much complex that we should also embrace the other and have empathy for what the other feels and why do the other person stands for their point of view.  

#### Conflict is... (_according to J.P Lederach_)
* Conflict can be understood as *that which keeps relationships and social structures honest, alive, and dynamically responsive to human needs*, aspirations, and growth.
* Conflict flows from life. Rather than seeing conflict as a threat, we can understand it as providing opportunities to grow and increase our understanding of ourselves, of others, and of our social structures. 
* Conflicts in relationships at all levels are the way life helps us to stop, assess, and take notice. 
* One way to truly know our humanness is to recognize the gift of conflict in our lives. *Without it, life would be a monotonously flat topography of sameness and our relationships would be woefully superficial.* 
* Conflict also creates life: through conflict we respond, innovate, and change.

Now we are going to start with the first reading that is from Jean Paul Lederach, that I really like. He said that **conflict is what keeps relationships and social structures, wholeness, alive, and dynamically responsive to human needs.** 

I mean, yes, I love this definition because we can see conflict as the price for change. That always non-linear thinking when sometimes we have a linear thinking and we think that our ideas are going to be the ultimate truth, but we have to see truth as a continuous evolution of a dialectic process. 

If we wouldn't have conflict, like our life would be monotonous would be flat, or everything would be the same and our relationships would be superficial. It would be a monologue. I am going to start here talking about the difference between a monologue and a dialogue.  

A dialogue is when you incorporate the other person and put in the other person's shoes and a monologue is when only you talk. Conflict is an expression of diversity. Conflict is an expression of the other conflict is an expression of the points of view that you are not seeing, and is also a gift for you to broaden and to improve and to incorporate others, to fulfill our needs and to evolve. Conflict flows from that. 

The idea of graviton and this training is for the people that is hearing this to not see conflict as a threat, but to see something as that provides opportunities to grow and increase our understanding of ourself and our social structures. If we have conflict in our relationships, that is a way that life helps us to stop, assess and take notice.  

We are using a transformative definition of conflict. Sometimes we think conflict as something bad or we relate conflict with violence, but violence is a response to conflict that is not led by dialogue. Instead, if we treat conflict with dialogue, we can promote peace. 

It's like changing our mindset of how we respond to conflict. if we respond to conflict with violence, we are inhibiting the change process the conflict has within. Instead of reacting with violence, when we have a conflict, we have to under to think, what is this conflict teaching me? Why I, am I having this conflict? Why, what, what can I learn from this conflict to be better in the future?  

### Transformative approach to conflicts
* Conflict is an opportunity, a gift. Conflict is normal in human relationships, and conflict is a motor of change.
* Rather than seeing peace as a static “end-state, ” conflict transformation views peace as a continuously evolving and developing quality of relationship.
* Conflict transformation is to envision and respond to the ebb and flow of social conflict as life-giving opportunities for creating constructive change processes that reduce violence, increase justice in direct interaction and social structures, and respond to real-life problems in human relationships.
* Transformation’s guiding question is this: How do we end something not desired and build something we do desire?

(00:14:50)

Continuing this transformative approach of conflict, I am saying that conflict is a gift from life. Conflict is human is normal in human relationships. It is, we have conflict within ourselves, within the others. We have conflict with our institutions. 

We have conflicts with our communities, and sometimes even conflicts happen without intention. Maybe you have the best intention to do something, and then you like forgot and a conflict arose, but you have to respond to that and you have to see it as something that needs a response. 

That is why it is and can be seen as a dialectic process. Rather than seeing peace as an end state and static idea, conflict transformation, piece abuse, peace as a continuously evolving and developing quality of relationships. 

Peace is not like we have peace and we're not gonna have any conflicts anymore. Peace is rather through the evolution of our relationships are able to address our own conflict. That we are not like if we have conflict, then we need the other person, or we try to impose our point of view, but seeing peace as the ability to manage conflicts as something proactive and good for the whole.  

I love these transformations guiding question, and you can ask our ourself, when you have a conflict, you can ask yourself this, and this can change instantly your mindset on the conflict. How do we end something not desired, build something we do desire. 

That is a stopping point. When you're in the middle of a conflict, you ask yourself this question, and you can, and you say, okay, if I continue with this path, I am going to have the same responses. I have to change my behavior. I have to change how am I seeing the conflict? 

I have to understand the other person to build something we desire because of that conflict transformation is like a way to respond to the flow of social conflict. and to create something about, about from this apparent, apparent opposite, and to create something from apparent prop opposites for the better, and that can help us to improve our social structures and to respond to real life problems.  


### Collecting information from world religions ( Galtung’s Transcend Method )

> following Hindu thought, remember: Conflict the Destroyer and Conflict the Creator; conflict as a source of violence and conflict as a source of development. The conflict worker has the third role as Preserver, transforming the conflict by avoiding violence, promoting development.
> following Buddhist thought, remember: Codependent origination, everything grows together in mutual causation. Conflicts have no beginning and no end, we all share the responsibility; no single actor (like statesmen) carries all the responsibility (monopoly) and no single actor carries all the guilt.
> following Christian thought, remember: Ultimately, the responsibility for conflict transformation lies with individuals and their individual responsibility and decisions to act so as to promote peace rather than violence, and the principle of hope.
> following Daoist thought, remember: Everything is yin and yang, good and bad, there is the high likelihood that the action chosen also has negative consequences and that action not chosen may have positive consequences; hence the need for reversibility, only doing what can be undone.
> following Islamic thought, remember: The strength deriving from submitting together to a common goal, including the concrete responsibility for the wellbeing of all.
> following Judaic thought, remember: The truth lies less in a verbal formula than in the dialogue to arrive at the formula, and that dialogue has no beginning and no end.

This is something that Johan Galtung uses for what he calls the transcend method. If we can see truth in a lot of things that have, that have been addressed in humanity. We can see that conflict management is antifragile because it has been addressed by a lot of the world religions. Each religion has its point of view to address conflicts and their concern of about managing conflicts, refer to us that this is something that we are going keep having.  

Even though some of the, of the religions fight over who has the truth, I really like the position that Durgadas explains. Sometimes that you can see mythology as something that can be used to express really complex ideas in a really simple language. Even though we can have like religious fights over what is the final truth, we can also build a certain way of thinking that by gathering different ideas from the religions. 

In the Hindu thought, you see, you can see conflict that is the destroyer and conflict is the creator. Conflict is a source of violent and conflict as a source of development, the conflict worker, as the third role as transforming and conflict by avoiding violence and promoting development. 

Well, the conflict worker is something that has been like one of the first ways to address conflict in, in human life.  

In the future, we are gonna still need conflict workers, even though we have a super automatized future. I'm really hard to believe that our conflicts can be solved by a machine. I think that this is something very human and that this is something that has, that has to be very human and that the conflict workers are going are like these small wheels that we have had through hu through human history and that we can still have in the future, because they sometimes, somehow they manage to work.  

In the beauty thought, it says that everything grows together in mutual causation conflicts has no beginning and no end. We all share the responsibility. No single actor carries the responsibility and no single carries all the guilt. This is something that we are also working on here in the TC by having mutual accountability, because we, we all are carrying the responsibility of the wellbeing of the community. 

As graviton, this is a very big role that we should, that we should have in the com in our different communities and having the following. The Christian thought the responsibility for conflict transformation lies with individual and in their individual responsibility and decisions. 

To act so that they promote peace, rather than in the dais thought, we can say everything is ding and yang, good and bad. There is high likelihood that the action chosen also has negative consequences.  

That action not chosen may have positive consequences, hence the need for reversibility only doing what can be undone this in Islamic, the strength deriving from submitting together to a common goal, including the concrete responsibility of the wellbeing of all. I really like this last one that is the truth lies less in a verbal formula than in the dialogue to arrive at the formula. That dialogue has no, and has no end this dialogue and to arrive at the formula. 

It is something that I can relate a lot to this because it's something that we, we can see as conflict management, not as conflict, not as solving just one conflict, but as, as a way to understand conflict in our lives to produce something change and to produce something better. It's not to arrive in a thesis because all thesis are gonna have Ansis is to be able to synthesize the, and to have empathy for the other points of view.
