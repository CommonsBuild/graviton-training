# Restorative Justice

[Restorative Justice Circles](https://oscr.umich.edu/article/restorative-justice-circles) (“Circles”) provide an opportunity for community members to come together to address harmful behavior in a process that explores harms and needs, obligations, and necessary engagement. 

**Who’s involved?**

* **Responsible Parties** — the individuals whose actions have harmed others and/or the community
* **Impacted Parties** — those who were directly harmed by the respondents’ actions
* **Affected Parties** — others who consider themselves or their community to have been harmed by the actions of the respondents
* **Supporting Parties** — friends or family of either the respondents or the affected parties
* **Facilitators** — training OSCR staff who facilitate the Circle

### PRESENTATION / WORKSHOP

Intro: Acknowledgement of our teachers & the legacy of circle-based justice built by millenia of pre-colonial cultures

Restorative Justice Theory: Dispute resolution can be fully decentralized, and what does fully decentralized mean

- Are you in an org currently? Do you have a stated conflict process? Would you know what to do if a team conflict arose?
- Brainstorm what types of conflict resolution can you think of? Is there a centralized party in each of these?
- Why doesn’t centralization work? (Review current justice systems)
- Go over quotes from FTP and D. Barter

### Acknowledgement - Many have come before us.

On that note, I'd like to just recognize that many people and communities have come before us in this work. It's easy when we come up with new nonprofit orgs and new DAOs and new projects to think that we are coming up with new concepts, but in a lot of ways, we are rediscovering concepts that humans who lived more in community in the past, we're really wise with ahead of us. 

Lots of indigenous cultures practiced restorative justice of some sort or another. So I just wanna acknowledge that when we speak about restorative justice or any of these like new age models of conflict resolution, to know that we're not necessarily inventing this and we're actually borrowing from some really wise cultures

### Navajo Peacemaking

> “The Peacemaker Court is "a court-annexed system of popular justice, whereby respected community leaders organize and preside over the traditional Navajo trial, 'ahwiniti (where they talk about you), in the community in which the dispute arises". The idea is based on the traditional Navajo institution of hozhooji naal 'aanii, or peacemaking. In Navajo tradition, "a person who claims to be injured or wronged by another [would] make a demand upon the perpetrator to put things right". The demand was referred to as nalyeeh, which means compensation as well as a request to make the relationship right. If the person was unable to approach the wrongdoer himself or herself, it was common for a relative to do so. If these informal methods failed, the victim or victim's relative would approach a respected community leader, referred to as a naat 'aanii or peacemaker, to assist with the problem.“

(00:05:03)    
Here's an example in the United States, the Navajo tribe also known Asay have a traditional form of conflict resolution called peacemaking. I'll just read a little portion of this quote, not the whole thing, but in Navajo tradition, a person who claims to be injured or wronged by another would make a demand upon the perpetrator to put things right, going directly to them. 

The demand was referred to as ma which means compensation as well as a request to make the relationship right. If the person was unable to approach the wrongdoer himself or herself, it was common for a relative to do so if these informal methods failed the victim or victim's relative would approach a respected community leader referred to as nota, or a peacemaker that assist with the problem. 

Just honoring that in many ways, these traditions come from far before our time. I have a lot of gratitude to the people who practice this and sharpen these tools before the industrial revolution allowed us to forget indigenous ways of life and then rediscover them and think that we're inventing something really sexy and new.  

### Dominic Barter

This next one is a video. It's an interview from Dominic barter who some people say he like invented restorative justice or like coined the term restorative justice. He probably wouldn't say that about himself. He has also the perspective of being a lifelong learner and he calls himself a student of conflict, but he has made waves in this community through his experience, devising conflict re resolution models for the ellas that he's lived in Brazil. 

> “I’m looking to restore connection within and between people and as communities. And then I'm looking for all the ways in which that manifests, in new acts which symbolize connection, just as the old acts symbolize disconnection.” - [Dominic Barter - What is restored in Restorative Justice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRjt8iZfi-8&ab_channel=NonviolentCommunicationNVC )

(00:11:54)    
**Dominic**:    How is the restorative justice process for you? The thing that is restored is always connection within people, between people and as communities, because the thing that is most on-goingly damaged has been connection. 

Lots of other painful things may have happened or may happen as a consequence of that diminished or broken connection within people, between people in communities. 

As I, in my way of reading why this works as it does it's connection that has been diminished or broken first and therefore it is connection that we seek to restore first. 

Just as all the stuff that we don't like is a consequence of that diminished or broken connection within and between people and as communities. The good stuff that we're creating, the conditions for reemerging is a consequence of connection within people, between people and as communities. 

Since I, my reading is that everything that we find that we're able to track observe record register comes in part from this connection. I wanna start with connection. 

All kinds of people have questioned whether restore or restorative is the most accurate word to use, but I'm looking to restore connection within and between people and their communities.  

Then I'm looking for all the ways in which that manifests in new acts, which symbolize connection just as the old acts symbolize disconnection.

(00:14:12)    
**Loie**:    I love this last thing that he said, and I wanna, I want to call this out again. It says, I'm looking to restore connection within and between people and those communities. Then I'm looking for all the ways in which that manifests in new acts, which symbolize connection just as the old acts symbolize disconnection. 

I love this because, it's a bit of a rabbit hole for me, but I have this area that in decentralized spaces where before there was the top of any hierarchical pyramid or process, **wherever there was a person at the top, we need to replace them with a process and have a process at the top**. 

Process don't have personality. Usually at least not as much as a person does right off the bat. I'm super interested in how we allow our processes to have persona and to be friendly. It comes in through ritual elements and through a community, really a dedicated community upholding the process. 

We've seen it in the TEC with the praise. That's a great example to me, of a process that has personality. Like there's no person that is the praise person. Who's like dishing out all the praise or administrating the process or anything, but still the praise process itself has this total jovial persona.  

I commend you guys as a community for being able to find within a process. That Dominic Barter is really right when he says we can look at old acts, old ways of conflict resolution, whatever that symbolize disconnection. Then we look for the new ones that actually symbolize connection. 

Is there something in the persona of this process that we're using that makes it connective? 


### Restorative Justice (marshall rosenberg)

There's the person affected by a crime.

The person who acted in a way creating pain for others.

The third party involved in restorative justice is the community that provided the education that contributed to the person's crime.

We want to restore the situation by replacing the education that led to this behavior with an education that supports their contributing to people's well being, rather than doing things that create suffering for them.

### Restorative Justice Theory
* Dispute resolution can be fully decentralized
* Restorative Justice in the Present Moment: why we ask about the NOW rather than the past

(00:40:08)    
**Loie**:    Thank you so much for catching me up on these things. I wanna just talk really briefly about the theory of restorative justice. It's a practice, a methodology that believes that dispute resolution can be fully decentralized. 

What that means is there is no external party that is the of anyone's fate. To me like for sure a judge is centralized. But even a mediator is a point of centralization. 

Someone that you are talking through rather than just talking to your the person you were in conflict with that is a point of centralization. 

In restorative justice, there are only facilitators. There are no judges, there are no mediators, there's no sentencing committee. There's no sentencing guidelines, sentences are called action plans and they are completely created by the folks closest to it. 

Also, the most important question that we use in a restorative justice circle is how are you now in relation to the conflict that happened? This is we stay in the present moment. 

That this really is underpinned by the book. That conflict is a gift mostly to our present and to our future. It's the opportunity to make things better in the future rather than dwelling on something in the past. Yeah, the justice, it dwells in the present moment in that way.  

(00:42:09)    
**Loie**:    I'm just gonna like rapid fire some questions at you guys. I'd love to hear your quick answers just to get a temperature check here. 

### Who knows the most about how a conflict should be resolved?

Who do you think in a group knows the most about how a conflict should be resolved in any organization or community which roles or which architects or which people in that community know the most about how a conflict should be resolved?  

(00:42:48)    
**Speaker 3**:    I wanna say the oldest people give the other least some credit.  

(00:42:53)    
**Loie**:    Okay. Okay. Any other, 

(00:42:56)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I would say also a mix between subject matter experts in the area of the conflict and also people specialized or trained in conflict management.  

#### The folks involved closely in it

**Loie**:    Okay. In restorative justice, we pretty much believe exclusively that the folks involved closely in this crime or this conflict know the most about how it should be resolved. In many cultures that use restorative justice, they also have like a higher respect for elders. 

Those folks usually have a seat at the table. They are considered a stakeholder in the conflict, but they're not really the ones who know how to the only people that know how to resolve a conflict are the people in the conflict. 

That's what we believe in restorative justice. 

### How are people most likely to follow an action plan/restitution/sentencing?

What about, how are people most likely to follow an action plan or a sentencing? Like in what way would you be able to form such a sentencing or a plan that you think would be the most success for people following it?  

(00:44:21)    
**Speaker 8**:    The people that are involved in the conflict then create the action plan and then can execute it because they're motivated because  

#### If they are a part of creating it

(00:44:31)    
**Loie**:    Ding. Exactly. This is a strong belief of restorative justice and probably some other conflict resolution models that you guys have studied during this training. What we have created. We feel a lot more accountability. If we've had a hand in it.

### Quick Question

(00:45:10)    
**Speaker 6**:    Can I ask a question?  

(00:45:13)    
**Loie**:    Sure.  

(00:45:15)    
**Speaker 6**:    There was something you said about the call out culture. How like what are the elements that need to be present for a call out culture to not become a canceling culture?  

(00:45:30)    
**Loie**:    That's a great question. A big one. Primarily the agreement around call out culture is really helpful to know that everybody has already, everybody who's participating in that community has already agreed that this is one of our methods that we will tap on. 

Strong relationships between one another and a real environment where your neighbor's success impacts your success. Right? This is where we are talking about aligning incentives. 

If you are if your colleague or fellow in your community, if their success is directly tied in with your own, then you won't have a motivation to just like blatantly call them out in a way to ally exclude them from the community. I don't know. Olivia, do you have any other answers to your own question?  

(00:46:52)    
**Speaker 6**:    Yeah, I, yeah. That I resonate with what you said of creating agreements mostly and having like a trust fabric that things will be resolved. Cuz maybe like canceling culture also comes from trauma of not wanting to be in the same space or to continue to be involved with someone that has caused someone else pain or things like that. Then if there is the trust that issue is being supported and that there will be a resolution that will feel good for all parts. Then yeah, 

(00:47:38)    
**Loie**:    That gave me two other ideas. Actually it just makes me think how like psychological, emotional care for all people really would help in that scenario. Right? Like to have a baseline in our society where like everyone is able to access and afford therapy, counseling, coaching, and maybe spiritual support as well. 

To have that as a baseline of your needs being taken care of allows you to phone call outs better in a way where you don't feel like you wanna run away out of the, and the other thing that brought up for me was just to give it in our rules that we would call it *roles, not souls*, but this general principle that you're never labeling a person when you are giving them negative feedback. 

It's never saying like you are this way. You are an offender, you're a problem causer, it's about focusing on the specific act or the specific pattern of acts that's happening and not assigning that as a persona of the person in front of you. 

That's something that restorative justice adheres to pretty strongly, it refuses to use the words victim. Generally we speak of stakeholders in a crime stakeholders, in a conflict and most, if we really need some distinction, we will say like a person who was harmed and a person who caused harm, cuz then we know that those people are really just people and their relation to the conflict, just certain actions they took. It's not an identity that they have.
