## BATNA: Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement

(00:22:19)
**Juan Carlos**:    Now that we are talking about making agreements negotiations, I want to explain this word that is **BATNA**. That is the Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement. This is like a very easy graph of how always we have most desired outcomes that sometimes differ and are far from the other one. 

We have least decide least acceptable agreement that we, that we are not going to, that we are not so much willing to make. Even though there more desired outcomes, we also have this mutual motivation zone that is of possible. 

The idea of negotiation is to try to build a bridge. What is building a bridge is when you, each of these and very separate from each other to get to that. Where you try to connect them. that is like what we say of building a bridge building a bridge association is to try to approach that are far from each other soon of possible agreement. 

Now that we are building a bridge, that that is takes us to a best alternative to that is like meeting halfway between parts or approaching and building like communication between, between these two parts between parts that are, that arefrom each other. I would like to use a framework that in one of the videos that I send with William UDI, because I think it's really practical for a purpose.

## How to Sustain the Bridge

He's saying how to sustain the bridge here. We are be building a bridge. We are bringing together people that are far away from each other and trying to take them to a agreement and bring them to hospital agreement. Here, yes, we can have, we can build that possible agreement, but the collapse doesn't have to be robust for a sustainable bridge. 

Sustainable are the balcony and the third side. what, what do we mean when we say the balcony? The balcony is state of mind going to the balcony is when you stress and when, when you don't know like how to solve this conflict, sometimes you just need a pause. Sometimes if we are having a conflict and we don't know how to manage it, and we keep arguing and arguing, we are not going to, we are not favoring the conflict stand the conflict solution.  

Instead we are favoring like the discussion and maybe an antagonist position. But it's very important to understand balcony a state of mind where, it it's a strategic, we can like 10 months making an agreement and building a bridge, but maybe in one moment of anger, we can throw the agreement to the garbage. 

It's important not only to make agreement as a bridge, but to have this calm state of mind, to know that the decisions that we're taking are like the best decisions and that we are handling the issue, trying to handle the issue, that to have the best outcome from it.

Also when you go to the balcony, you can also remember, what is the price that you wanted? what, what is the thing that you are fighting for? Maybe you can like calm down without cause. Then understand that if you want to have your price, maybe you can like feed with some of the things that other part wants. 

Also going to the balcony is something that gives us a different perspective. We are like too much into a travel and sometimes we are spending on it too much, and we are seeing it from the same point of view. We have to like go to the balcony and then we can see that same email from a different perspective. 

Like here value, it's not like a physical place. It's more like a state of mind where you have to keep yourself like understanding and having the ice on the price and having, and understanding different perspectives. That if the conflict is not resolving, it's sometimes it's good to give time to think. 

Sometimes you want to like the things to get addressed really quickly. That harms the conflict. Sometimes we have to let things like calm down and talk to the parties so that, so that the communication can come through.

  > i grew up partly in San Francisco and this looks a little bit like the Golden Gate Bridge if you imagine it and getting to yes focuses on techniques for how do you build that bridge. What i've found is that building that bridge is the core of the method of negotiation, but there are two pillars. Those two pillars on either side that are critical if we're going to be successful in getting yes in challenging times

  > A negotiator’s BATNA is the course of action he will pursue if the current negotiation results in an impasse. An evaluation of your best alternative to a deal is critical if you are to establish the threshold at which you will reject an offer. 
  > 
  > Effective negotiators determine their BATNAs before talks begin. When you fail to do so, you’re liable to make a costly mistake—rejecting a deal you should have accepted or accepting one you’d have been wise to reject. In negotiation, it’s important to have high aspirations and to fight hard for a good outcome. But it’s just as critical to establish a walkaway point that is firmly grounded in reality.

  > The idea behind the adversary system is that the truth will emerge when opposing sides present their cases as aggressively as possible. Even though this ideal is not always realized, the principle is probably sound. The problem with the adversary method in civil cases is not theoretical but practical. First, it is not the most effective way to resolve some kinds of disputes. Second, it can be made more effective for most kinds of disputes by borrowing certain of the nonadversarial features of other forms of dispute resolution. Third, from both the societal and the individual perspective, we may no longer be able to afford it in its undiluted form.

  > While no communication medium is as rich in social cues as face-to-face meetings, some are richer than others. On the phone, we can read a lot into our counterpart’s tone of voice and how quickly they get down to business. On a video conference, we can assess the other party’s receptiveness to a proposal from their smile or, conversely, their crossed arms and frown. Emails and texts tend to be “impoverished” forms of communication because they lack nonverbal and visual cues, though emojis can help.

  > Communication media also vary in their synchronicity, or the degree to which people can be engaged in the same activity at the same time. Phone calls, conference calls, and videoconferences—and, to some extent, text messages—allow us to carry on a continuous conversation. By contrast, emails (and sometimes texts) tend to extend the communication process because of delays between messages, note Swaab and Galinsky.
