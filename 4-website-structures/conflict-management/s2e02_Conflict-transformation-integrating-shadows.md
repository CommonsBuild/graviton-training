**Juan Carlos**:    How can we see conflict transformation as a political philosophy in our lives and in our organizations.

We will be talking about conflict competence and what is conflict? Competence is the ability and the tools that we have to react to a conflict in our organization. We can see those also as workplaces because they are places of a large amount of people with some goal orientation. 

### Conflict Competence in the DAOspace
#### Educational support for all, and coaching for induviduals as needed

This character of personal deevlopment expectation for the workplace is quite a tall order. On a practical level, personnel require two types of developmental support: firstly, training for everyone in conflict competence, and secondly, individual coaching where it is warranted.

#### Dispute Resolution Services

Additionally, expecting two people to always be able to sort out differences on their own is not realistic. Third-party support for mediation and facilitated group processes should also be available.

* [#97 Support Conflict Competence With Policy Development](https://www.theconflictjourney.com/2020/05/24/97-support-conflict-competence-with-policy-development/) Gordon White


That is something that will naturally cause conflict. It's natural, that conflict may arise because there's also always going to be different points of view, different tensions, different ways of seeing things. The important of the importance of talking about conflict competence is that when a conflict arrives, you have clear ways to manage it. That there is no uncertainty of how things are going to be processed by the system.  

Conflict competence requires two things: first is training for everyone. Secondly, individual coaching where is warranted. This is something that I want to emphasize because sometimes we just want to have like conflict management in our organization, but we just want to have like the managers, helping the people when they have a conflict, but we are not developing like a training for everyone or to understand this. 

That has to do a lot with what we said in the first session that gravity is not only about conflict management, when it happens, but it also focuses a lot on prevention and building conflict competence in your organization, helps people to break the ice that stops really the reception of feedback. 

We need safe spaces and for people to express feedback. When feedback is not well received that immediately, 

After we have this competence in our organization and after, we normalize talking about conflicts that is when the dispute resolution services can be built. It's very difficult when you try to offer a dispute resolution service, when there's no conflict competence, because people is going to be completely blocked or it's not going to be facilitating the dispute resolution service. 

When there's competence, it's normal to talk about conflict. This is something that we develop by listening to others and by learning to how to express our opinions. That's why it's so important also to be practicing non-violent communication.  

We can communicate the differences, but without getting triggered by the other, but rather being aware of their needs and the message they are trying to share. 

Expecting that two people always sort out the difference is not realistic. That's why we also promote this third party support for mediation and facilitation that should be available for the organization. These third party support. 

### First Generation Gravitons

![](https://i.imgur.com/wK3qy19.png)

They are the gravitons, they are easy to access agents where you can and people that you can contact and that they are available in the community to serve different types of conflicts, maybe to have an advice process and maybe to initialize a feedback loop. 

This is very interesting because we were talking precisely about feedback and how can we give feedback to the organization?  

These 17 people that were the first generation of gravitons, who, at least in the TEC, are easy access people where you can talk to them about any uncomfortable situation that you may be leaving or any idea that you want to give to another person or to the system that can be channeled through them. 

This is why it's important to have your poaps because after this training, the people that has at least six pops in their account, they will be able to appear in this list in your organization, and act as an access point to request conflict management in the different organizations that are participating.  

### What is conflict?
* **What is seen**: Each participant pushes for their point of view.
* **What is not seen**: Why do they want their opinion to be heard.

![](https://i.imgur.com/oVQfUAE.png)

For conflict resolution, more than a final truth, we need to understand the reasons why each one is attached to their position.

The oranges example: [MediationTools.com - Article: "The Orange Story"](http://www.mediationtools.com/articles/smbj9605.html)

**Deeper questions:**
- What do they want?
- What are their needs?
- What are their interests?
- An expression of difference

(00:07:37)    
What is conflict? Conflict is a differing interpretations of reality. When we stand from one point, we may think that we are right, but the other person, from their point of view may think that they are right. 

What is seen in a conflict is everyone pushing for their point of view. What is not seen is why do they want their opinion to be heard? More than a final truth, we need to understand why each one is attached to their positions. 

This takes me to the [orange example](http://www.mediationtools.com/articles/smbj9605.html) that I always tell. There were two girls that were fighting for an orange and the mom then split the orange in half. Then she saw that one of the girls was squeezing the orange and the other girl just like used the skin of the orange and threw the pulp away.  

What this scenario shows us is that if the two girls would have better communication, or maybe if the mom would have tried to gather more information from them, they could have arrived to a beneficial solution for the both of them. They could have used the orange a hundred percent, the one that wanted the peel and the other wanted the juice. 

That way we can have a better solution and a beneficial solution for both sides instead of the rational solution that happens without gathering more information. This is something very related to the prisoners dilemma. When we don't have information of the other, we may behave to our benefit, but that doesn't mean that would be the best outcome for everyone, for all the agents.  

What we are trying to do here in gravity is to facilitate communication and to gather more information, to take a decision, and to try to promote agreements between two people that are beneficial for both of them, rather than like benefiting one over the other. 

The first questions to ask when we are trying to manage a conflict is what does each part want and what are their needs? What are their interests? And maybe try to see if they can agree that their initial position was not the final truth, and that maybe we can have a new alternative born from the integration of the other, where the reality can fit both needs. 

Through communication, we can promote better decisions and through, and by gathering information, we make better choices. It's important to facilitate this communication in order to not only seize things from our own point of view, but to be able to be empathic with the other. 

The reality sometimes is not only what we see from it and that the other one also, when we understand them, they have their reasons for doing things. This way we can treat each other as peers and not impose any solution to anyone, but trying to promote an agreement through communication. 

### Why is Gravity Relevant in Token Engineering
![](https://i.imgur.com/e0rkEfG.png)\
[Why is Gravity relevant in Token Engineering?](https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/why-is-gravity-relevant-in-token-engineering-e28ae4a5b5a1) Juan Carlos Bell Llinás

I bring this image because it's very important then to embrace conflict. We are going to have conflict every day in our lives. We are going to have conflict internally, and we are going to have conflict externally. There is conflict with the institutions. There is conflict with other people. There is conflict with processes. There is conflict with tools.  

(00:13:00)    
What we need to do is to embrace that conflict and not seeing it as something is strange in our lives, but rather as a part of life. This is something that we refer to as the shadow. Sometimes we just want to see the light things, and we don't want to recognize the shadow, but that recognition of the shadow is embracing. 

The whole experience is understanding that the light is not only what is, what exists, but that each light has a shadow. We should be strong enough to manage it, not only in our organizations, but also in our lives. 

We need to make people that can process conflict and then make organizations that can process conflict. This is why we are talking about a transformative approach to conflict. Cause conflict is an opportunity, a gift. 

Conflict is normal in human relationships, and conflict is a model of change. Rather than seeing pieces as end state conflict transformation, use peace as a continuously evolving and developing quality of relationship. 

### Transformative approach to conflicts
* *Conflict is an opportunity, a gift*. Conflict is normal in human relationships, and conflict is a motor of change. 
* Rather than seeing peace as a static “end-state, ” conflict transformation views peace as a continuously evolving and developing quality of relationship. 
* Conflict transformation is to envision and respond to the ebb and flow of social conflict as life-giving opportunities for creating constructive change processes that reduce violence, increase justice in direct interaction and social structures, and respond to real-life problems in human relationships. 
* *Transformation’s guiding question is this: How do we end something not desired and build something we do desire?*

Conflict transformation is to response to the flow of life and create constructive change processes that reduce violence, increase justice in direct, in interaction of, and social structures and respond to real life problems in human relationship. The transformation guiding question is this, how do we end something not desired and build something we do desire.  

This is a question that we should ask ourselves every time that we are in a conflict, how do we end something that we don't desire and build something we do desire because sometimes we only focus on criticizing or like analyzing things that we don't desire, but it's also important to always propose a solution. 

That's something that we always ask to the people that is participating in gravity. We always ask them, what would be the best outcome for you in this situation? What do you propose? 

The idea in gravity is not for us to be like judges and tell the people what should they do. Rather like give people information so that they can take the better, the best decisions, and we can help them in their decision taking.  

### Conflict is... (according to J.P Lederach)
* Conflict can be understood as *that which keeps relationships and social structures honest, alive, and dynamically responsive to human needs*, aspirations, and growth.
* Conflict flows from life. Rather than seeing conflict as a threat, we can understand it as providing opportunities to grow and increase our understanding of ourselves, of others, and of our social structures. 
* Conflicts in relationships at all levels are the way life helps us to stop, assess, and take notice. 
* One way to truly know our humanness is to recognize the gift of conflict in our lives. *Without it, life would be a monotonously flat topography of sameness and our relationships would be woefully superficial*. 
* Conflict also creates life: through conflict we respond, innovate, and change.  

(00:16:40)    
It's important always to see what can be the actual solutions that people propose and maybe start working from them to try to meet halfway in the process of getting into an agreement. Conflict can be understood as that which keep relationships and social structure, honest, alive, and dynamically respond to human needs. 

Conflict flows from life. We can understand it that as providing opportunities to grow and increase our understanding of ourselves, of others and our social structures. 

Actually one way to truly know our humanness is to recognize the gift of conflicting that in our lives, because without it life would be a monotonously flat topography of sameness and our relationships would be who superficial. 

I am trying to frame conflict as a model of change, as a expression of diversity, and that is something that carries a lot of wisdom the conflict itself, but it has to be properly managed. 

If you don't manage well conflict, you can end up having violence, you can end up like imposing a solution over the other, or you can like inhibit yourself from the conflict and not participate in it, but it's important to try to channel properly conflict and avoid some of the basic problems that we see in conflict management.

### Common problems in conflict management
* Lack of trust in the system’s capabilities to manage the situation.
* Biased or few communication between parties.
* Rock-solid points of view (low negotiation margins).
* Associating ideas to People. E.g. “Castrochavismo”
* Value propositions. E.g. “Good - Bad”
* Ridiculing the problem (not recognizing it).
* Hurting feelings (can trigger people to take irrational decisions)
* Legitimacy of the agreements (what ensures the decision).
* Accountability of decisions and conflict resolution follow-up.

A common problem to have conflict management is that we don't trust that the system is going to be helpful, or that we think that maybe the system is biased. Why should I trust the process? 

Other common problem in conflict management is to have like few communication between parts or to have like rock solid positions, or points of view, or associating idea ideas to people and saying, okay, this is making an enemy image of the other, or ridiculing the problem, making value propositions, hurting feelings of the other person.  

Another problem in conflict management is we don't have legitimacy of the agreement. What ensures the decisions and accountability of the decisions and conflict resolution follow up all these problems that are things that normally happen when we are trying to solve a conflict. 

These are some of the things that we are trying to tackle through Gravity, we are trying to build trust in the system so that people know that we can manage the situation. 

We are trying to facilitate communication between parties and try to be self determined so that we are not biased over one part, or the another. 

We try to meet halfway and soften solid points of view by asking the people where are you willing to compromise or negotiate in this situation? If we want to reach an agreement, we also need something to negotiate with.  

It's not like I am in my position and I will not give any step towards the other, but we try to make a negotiation margin where people can, say, okay, I give you this and you give me that. 

If there is a solution that you don't like, and maybe there is a solution that I am proposing, what would be like a third solution that can be born from this apparent division. 

Also we don't associate people with the with problems. We differentiate the people from the problem. The people is never the problem. 

That person is involved in that situation, they aren't the problem. We also try to stay away from value propositions. 

We respect everyone's problems and we recognize them and everyone's problems are equally important. It doesn't matter if it's like lack of recognition or something small or something bigger acting against the values of the community. All problems are important. 

Its also important that we respect the feelings of people. This is something that we will be digging much in the NVC book club. We will be deep diving in NVC. Why feelings are so important to be heard and to be like processed in order to identify needs and needs that sometimes are not reflected in the conflict, and then try to meet the needs of each part. 

Also we bring legitimacy of the agreements because the graviton are witnesses of the agreements that are done, the mediation in gravity. And we have accountability of decisions and follow up because we had a registry that was done in Google spreadsheet. 

Now we are working to migrate some of that registry into a sand hub so that everyone can be, can have the accountability of the decisions and the actions that were done through gravity. 

This is also other thing that I wanted to say that gravity's still very new and we still have a lot of things to improve. We are also having some changes that you will be informed through these graviton trainings. 

The one I just said about our conflict registry on sand hub, and we will like be able to give certain information, but without giving too much detail, we are not going to share the name of the people that participated in the conflict. 

This we can have a database of that can be analyzed of what are, what were the conflicts and what were the actions that were taken.  

### Window of Tolerance
![](https://i.imgur.com/Yyqzv0t.png)

(00:25:25)    
**Juan Carlos**:    And also other common problem that we have in conflict management is that sometimes we don't really take into account the window of tolerance that we all have. This is a psychological concept that is that we have like a boundaries where we can become like hyper aroused or hyper aroused. When we are trying to solve a conflict, it's very important to stay in the margin of the window of tolerance of the optimal arousal zone. That you can, I am sure that all of you have experienced this. You are trying to solve a conflict with someone, and then you are in the optimal arousal, you are getting to an agreement, but then you say something that the other person didn't, and then he, or she like gets upset. Then we take them out of their optimal arousal zone.  

(00:26:37)    
**Juan Carlos**:    And they now, they don't want to reach an agreement. Because of their anger or because of their, yeah. Of their emotions now they will be even able to throw down all the work that we have been trying to get to an agreement because of their anger. That has to do a lot of why processing feelings is so important in manage in managing conflict. Because when we are trying to manage a conflict, we are trying to reach a, yeah. An agreement, a rational agreement with the other person. When we take them out of their optimal arousal zone, they might take irrational decisions. Maybe, yeah. I am going to give an example. I am talking with my girlfriend over, I don't know, over going to a friend's house.  

(00:27:42)    
**Juan Carlos**:    And, we are talking and we are going to reach an agreement. If I then say something that triggers her anger, maybe she's going to say, no, I don't want to go. Maybe that is because of being in her hyper arousal also, and not because actually she didn't want to go to visit our friend. Yeah, it's very important to always to manage conflict, to be able to manage feelings as well and manage emotions and try to set a safe space. Because if everyone starts like getting aroused and maybe saying to the other things that they don't, we are never going to have an agreement on that thing, because we are going to go through the branches and then we're going to start playing like a game of judgment. We lose the focus on the agreement. Then we start, yeah.  

(00:28:59)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Like going through adversarial positions, instead of, looking at the agreement we start getting into positions of you tell, told me that, and then I told you that this, and then it's like something that doesn't like let, to reach an agreement and rather promotes yeah. To take I irrational decisions based on emotions. 

### Conflict management as a political philosophy
* *Conflict itself is not bad*. It is an expression of the diversity of interests, ideas and points of view. It arises in all human relationships and, like crises, can be excellent opportunities to grow, emerge stronger, learn and improve.
* When assuming conflicts are negative, people and institutions tend to fear them and adopt one of these two attitudes: 
  1. they resort to force, power or violence to crush them; or 
  2. they ignore them hoping they will pass without addressing them.
* When a conflict arises, both parties may believe they have the only logical stance, since each sees the situation exclusively from their particular point of view. Hence the need and importance of dialogue, as a mechanism that allows the search for collectively constructed solutions through listening and incorporating the other’s perspective.
* The quality of an institution is not determined by whether or not it has conflicts, but by how it manages to address them.

Why do I see conflict management as a political philosophy? Because that conflict itself is not bad. It's an expression of diversity of interest. I ideas and points of view. It arises in all human relationships and crisis can be excellent opportunities to grow, emerge, stronger, learn, and improve. 

I am sure that all of us have had conflict that, in their initial stage, we thought that nothing good could come out of them.  

Also after some time we can see good things that have come after certain conflicts that we have lived in our lives because they have given us, they have learned teach us things and they have made us stronger, and they have helped us to change some things. 

When assuming that conflicts are negative people and institutions tend to feel to fear them and adapt one of these two attitudes reserve to force power violence, or they ignore them hoping that they will pass without others in them. 

Both of these alternatives are like the ones I showed in the previous graphic not being able to stay in the optimal arousal zone to reach through, to reach an agreement through the dialogue. That when a conflict arises, both parties may believe that they have the only logical stance since each sees the situation exclusively from their particular point of view.  

The need and importance of dialogue is that it is a mechanism that allows the search for collectively constructed solutions through listening and incorporating the other perspective. 

That means that the quality of an institution is not term not determined by whether or not it has conflicts, but how it manages to address them. 

This is something that we are seeing in the DAO space and a good DAO is not the one that doesn't have any conflict that would be mysterious. Conflict is normal in DAOs. Actually the quality of a DAO is in how it manages the conflicts that happen in them?  

(00:32:23)    
The book discourse on colonialism, by Aimé Césaire, mentions that a civilization is decadent when it cannot solve the problems it creates. 

If a DAO creates problems or creates conflicts in the decision taking in their coordination, in their diversity, that should also be able to take care of that, of that dynamics that are being created inside of them. 

### The dialectic cycle

![](https://i.imgur.com/pUu61dA.png)

Why I say that conflict management is a political philosophy. Because in philosophy, and in politics, we see that evolution is not like a straight line and rather is an spiraled process where we initially have a thesis and then that thesis like brings an antithesis, and then we have a synthesis, but that synthesis then also has an antithesis.  

We're also always evolving through dialogue. Through the existence of otherness is, if we only had a thesis and never had an antithesis, we would like be still and don't have actually the change. 

Conflict is that model of change that existence of the other, that recognition of a different point of view is what brings a thesis to become a synthesis. That's why it's also important not to avoid conflict, because that way we also would avoid change and evolution. 

If we are not open to listen to feedback, there should be like a lot of things that won't be taken into account in the system. Also the system would become rigid and not adaptable to the needs required in the context.  

We can see in Marx dialectical materialism, that the evolution in history has been through the conflict that has happened between dualities in our societies. If we eliminate that duality, we never take important points of view that could help us improve our processes. 

### D. Easton’s Political “Black box” System Cycle

![](https://i.imgur.com/tR0nQKL.png)

More about: http://online.sfsu.edu/sguo/Renmin/PowerPoint%20slides/psc720-comparative%20politics_003_system%20theories.ppt

This is also very related to why conflict management can be seen as a political philosophy, because this is a, the political system designed by David. It says that through demands and support the political system acts as a black box that takes decision or policies, and that are, and that are made output to the environment that then are received that as feedbacks as input for new demands and for new supports for that political system to act.  

### J.P. Lederach. Conflict Transformational platform

![](https://i.imgur.com/pLywJcf.png)

In that way, what we are trying to promote with gravity is a conflict transformational platform. That means a system that can generate and re generate change processes responsive to both immediate episodes and the rational context. 

We are seeing conflict as the existence of anthesis and evolution is not a straight line. What we are trying to do is to trying to have a platform that doesn't get stuck when conflict arise, but rather than that, it feels for conflict to propose new solutions that are integrated in the system. 

This is what we're trying to do with gravity, so that those are not so much affected by ly negatively by conflict, but rather that they can be affected positively from conflict to transform and to respond to their, to the needs that conflict was trying to show to the system. 

This take us to the framework for conflict analysis that we are trying to promote in gravity.  

### Gravity Framework for conflict analysis

![](https://i.imgur.com/T7srUOu.png)

(00:38:32)    
First, we make an identification of cases, and we have a referral of the dispute by the parties and this first step we can associate it with the people, who are the actors? What is their relationship of power? What are their interests? 

**This is what we call the observation process.** When a conflict arise, **the first thing we do** is map who are the actors and what are the interests. 

**That takes us to the second step.** That is the screening of the dispute and invitation to attend mediation. Is when we focus on understanding the problem, when we try to know what is the context of the problem, what are the arguments of the different sides? What are the aspirations and interests? What is the reach of the conflict? 

To continue on the process, there should be like an invitation to attend a mediation or to attend the conflict management process. That means that there should be willingness from the actors to participate in the process, because we cannot impose this process to people who don't want to participate in it. 

This is a hundred percent based in consent on the ideas of the two people thinking that through communication, they can reach a better decision than the one they can take without communication. 

Through this screening of the problem, we also try to understand the feelings that are involved in the problem, and that are triggering the different parts with that.  

We conduct an ADR process looking for possible solutions. This is that we have a joint session with the parties, and we look for possible solutions, but first we have private sessions, which each of the parties to try to design an alternative.

This is something that I learned from experience that if you have a joint session without having the proper amount of private sessions, the mediation process can go out of control because you need to have the parties more or less agree on certain points so that during the mediation, you can like certify those agreements. 

If you come too raw to a mediation without having like communicated well with the parties, during that mediation, things could go wrong.  

(00:42:24)    
**Juan Carlos**:    And some of the parties can like go out of their optimal arousal zone and throw the process down. It's important to have a good preparation of the process before engaging in a mediation. In gravity we are going to have continued education alternatives, and we are going to have later a course that deeps dives on mediation, because this graviton training is an introduction to a large amount of topics that need like everyday practice. After this graviton training, you are not going to be like a skillful mediator. After this graviton training, you are going to have like the basic principles and the basic ideas of what a mediation is and how can you participate, but first, but everything needs practice and everything needs continue the education. Also other good practice that we have been doing is that when a conflict occurs and a mediation happens, we always have like one more skilled graviton.  

(00:43:50)    
**Juan Carlos**:    And one graviton that is not so much trained so that they can understand better the process. Yeah, that way we can improve the learning curve for new gravitons to know how the process works and to get skill on the mediation process. Yeah this is a training that gives a lot of information. The idea is that after this training, you continue engaging with gravity and that you continue practicing what you, what we learn and you continue helping us develop even better our processes, because yeah, the Gravitant would be the contributors to this organization. After we have this process of mediation, we have a post mediation administration at and party responsibilities that is that we try to look for possible solutions. Then we try to implement an agreement and be witness of that agreement so that we can have follow up mechanism of the agreement. We also sometimes design some like KPIs for the implementation of the agreement.  

(00:45:35)    
**Juan Carlos**:    And after that a month or two weeks ago, we also sync with the parties that participated in the mediation process to know how the, how things are evolving. Gravity aims to be, to facilitate a conflict management cycle for dos. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/ivuHi1d.png)

The basic idea of gravity is that we can have always an external management layer that is involving a third party with authority to solve that dispute in one favor or the other, to solve the dispute in favor or one side or the another. 

With gravity, we are trying to implement an internal management layer within the organization where the decisions are not taken by this third party with authority but rather by being self composed. 

The outcomes of a dispute emerge from dialogue between the parties come from compromising for win-win solutions. This is the process that we saw before we first have like a referral and education of conflict, then that goes through internal management.  

If the conflict can be solved internally through negotiation between the parts or with a mediation, from a graviton, then we have like in an internal follow up of the decisions. Then we have also like a periodical of transformational actions to work on prevention. 

Even though that we always work around prevention, we are also always going to have referral of conflict. This is a cycle, and we have transformational actions that can help solve a conflict. If the transformational actions are not enough to solve the conflict, then we can always jump to the external management layer and having a arbitration process that would have like an external follow up. 

The idea is that not everything requires a third with authority, but rather we can facilitate the communication between.

### Winnicott at Work

OK. I am going to go in this reading that was in the pre-reading learning list, but I didn't add it to the slides. I will be talking about this and I will jump to the conclusions because it's a bit long. 

[Winnicott at Work: Potential Space and the Facilitating Organization](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aXszmXnVCF_LN09mqBs_goDBR0cCj1Ay/view) Michael A. Diamond
> Facilitating and authentic organizations are substantially more bottom-up in their decision making and strategic implementations, and much less top-down and management driven.
> 
> Authentic organizations are possible where leaders attend to and minimize the inevitable emergence of social defense systems (or defensive organizations). Nevertheless, individual members will no doubt engage in self- and other-deceptive and protective practices, which suppress and camouflage their actions, errors, and failures of implementation. Organizational participants will unavoidably defend themselves against anxieties. Social defense systems ostensibly protect participants from having to face conflicts, problems, errors, and the assumption of personal responsibility. These false self systems suppress the capacity to face mistakes and imperfections. Thus, the facilitation of good-enough organizations and leaders entails managing the destructive expansiveness of narcissism and the false idealization of leadership. Demystification and deflation of the idealized narcissistic leader can result from a process of analysis and intervention such as the case illustration above. In some instances, narcissistic leaders accept changes that come with a more facilitating environment where workers offer genuine feedback and engagement in reflective dialog.

The idea of this reading is that sometimes we promote false selves in organizations and that also like promotes an organizational identity. What is a false self in an organization? It's a self where you are only seeing like an object or like as a part of a wheel in the structure. 

But you are not take taken as a full in individual who has needs besides the organization. What I am trying to say is that we should promote authentic selves in an organizations.  

Authenticity is to be able to say, Hey, today, I'm not feeling well. Sometimes we promote these false selves. You have to be good all the time. You have to have be available all the time and you have to deliver all your things perfectly. That really makes a false idea of who we are. 

We should promote true selves and make space for the creativity that can come from conflict and to not civilize this human side that we all have.  

Sometimes we only talk about work in DAOs and that's why I always talk about that. It's important to have lounges or spaces for people to talk about non-related to work things because we are not only like the avatars in our screen and we are human beings and we all have different problems in our life. 

It's important to have a space, to feel support from our community and to help each other in the different problems that we may be leaving. 

Maybe you are acting really good in your job, but you are having an interpersonal conflict that makes it challenging to enjoy the collaboration. The organization shouldn't only care about reaching goals, but also for the wellbeing and the development of the people who is inside.  

It's important to promote safe spaces, to talk about conflict and to request support from the community. This also fosters advice process in the last call, we were talking about advice process and how can we foster it? 

Through lounges and through safest spaces, we can make that our organizations understand more the authenticity of the people and actually deal with people and not only treat treating people as yeah, as numbers or as only caring for their contributions, but also caring for the wellbeing. 

This is something that would help a lot, the DAO space, because DAOs are trying to be like better institutions that the ones we have now. That to have these better institutions is not only to make them like faster or capable of doing more things, but also that the people who participate in them feel well and that they feel that their needs are taken into account, and that they have a voice. 

We cannot promote agency in the DAOs space, if we don't give voice to the people and giving voice to the people is making all these safe spaces to be able to talk about conflict, to talk about diversity of points of view, and to recognize that shadow in order to be able work on it. 

If we never recognize the shadow, we will never be able to work on it. These spaces bring up the shadow in organizations are really important.  

A conflict transformational platform should be short term responsive and long term strategic. The redefining characteristic of such platform is the capacity to generate and regenerate change processes, responsive to both immediate episodes and the relational context.
