It's a good experience for all of us. If you want, you can close your, your camera and we will go to through the meditation.  

Take a comfortable position wherever you are at. You can be in your seat, or if you want to stand, you can do it as well. You can close your eyes or you can do it with your eyes open. Have some deep breaths, now gain conscious of where you are at, where you are at in your house, where you're at in your city, where you're at in your country and where you're at in the world and the boundaries of your body.  

You can touch your hands and you can touch your knees and touch your, your legs and get in touch with yourself. Try to see yourself and ask yourself, who are you? And what are the feelings that you have had this week? 

What has been the most predominant thoughts that you have had in this week, or in this day, and try to recognize if those feelings and those thoughts have made you happy. If you feel proud of feeling those feelings, and if you don't feel proud for feeling your feelings, also ask yourself why and what can you do to be more comfortable with your own thoughts and with your own feelings.  

Try to get a little bit inside of you and connect and understand what has been like the ideas that have been guiding your thoughts and your minds and your feelings now that you are deeply connected with yourself, and that you are deeply connected with your feelings without moving. 

If you had a camera in your imagination, take three steps back from yourselves, from yourself. Now you are not seeing the world from your point of view, rather than that, you are seeing yourself as a third person. 

When you see yourself what do you feel when you times we see others as third persons as separated from ourselves. 

When we see others, sometimes we think of an advice or a word that we want to say to others, but now think on an advice that you would like to tell yourself, a word that you would like to tell yourself as if you were seeing yourself as other person, because it's always very easy to advise others and to, yeah. 

Like we always have a good word for others, but sometimes we don't have good words for ourself. 

Give yourself a good advice and like, yeah, it is like, what would you say to yourself and how do you see the feelings that you feel and that move you as to yourself outside from you? 

Would you give yourself a problem on the back and say, good job, man, you're doing amazing? or, or would you say to yourself, okay, you can do better. Give yourself an advice, but try that advice comes with love. Don't try to judge yourself or say anything bad to yourself, just give yourself an advice keep doing what you're doing. 

Put more love on what you're doing, or yes. or like control your emotions, or like, be more wise with the, with the words you said, you can keep you the advice you gave to yourself. That is a gift that you made to yourself today. When you feel comfortable, you can tell me something to end this meditation.
