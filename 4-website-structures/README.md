Gravitation can be described as a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass or energy—including planets, stars, galaxies, and even light—are brought toward (or gravitate toward) one another.

Newton says that "all bodies whatsoever are endowed with a principle of mutual gravitation" by which "all bodies must mutually gravitate towards one another."
