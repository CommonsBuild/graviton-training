## What Is A Schelling Point?
> **DEF**: A focal point (or Schelling point) is a solution that people tend to choose by default in the absence of communication.
> 
> GravityDAO’s aim is to generate, in our members & partner organizations, a proactive anti-fragile organizational culture through robust sensemaking, shared mental models & language systems, human-centric & ethical technology and services that bring us together even in the absence of communication.
> 
> This harmonizes with TEC’s mission to be the Schelling Point for Token Engineering.

In token engineering commons, we often talk about ourselves as a shelling point and I'm not sure that everyone knows what a shelling point is, but the idea behind the token engineering commons is that we would become a shelling point for token engineering. 

That is to say, we should become the people who other token engineers turn to and choose by default in the absence of communication or other options.  

(00:04:25)    
I've basically written this out to say that the idea behind Gravity and the future Gravity do is to generate within our members and the partner organizations who we service and the DAOs that we speak to: 

a proactive anti-fragile organizational culture through robust sensemaking, shared mental models & language systems.

Often we spend a lot of time trying to figure out what let's say, the right programming languages for doing a particular project, but we often don't spend time coming up with shared mental models and language systems in which we can discuss how cultural things can work. 

Often, because we don't do that, certain kinds of conflict can arise and, or the erosion of trust, which is a huge part of what we are here to do is to create trust. With human and ethical technology and services, that would bring us together even in the absence of communication.  

The whole purpose behind Gravity is to find ways to do exactly this.

As gravitons, it's important to recognize that all people in our organizations contain a psychological shadow.

> ### Role of Gravitons
> 
> All people and organizations contain a psychological shadow, and the role of Gravitons is to be highly aware of the presence of BLOCK/DISOWN/PROJECT mechanisms and how they reveal themselves inside conflicts and how we can prevent their occurrence by establishing thorough systems of Trust Creation through effective Curation, Moderation and smooth Cross-pollination. 

Our job is to be highly aware of the presence of these when people are trying to do a positive thing, there is a BLOCK/DISOWN/PROJECT mechanism, which can come up and to become aware of how those things reveal themselves before and after conflict is already arisen. 

The point of being a graviton is to try to get to the point where you're creating trust and then manage it at the same time when those trust mechanisms have broken down. We're thinking both preventatively and in terms of trying to work out how to respond to those things effectively when things do occur. 

The third three basic mechanisms that I've talked about, that we do, where we typically, when we're speaking about trust creation in a online situation like this, it's often true that we have curated material that's come before us and we have moderators, and then we have cross pollination things which are happening.  

(00:07:10)    
**Durgadas**:    And so there's actually a fair amount that you need to know as a graviton, to both figure out how to create trust and to deal with it once it's once bad things are happening. At the point where we're here, in the middle as moderators to assist with all three of these processes. 

> ### Skills of Gravitons
> - COMPASSION
> - MINDFULNESS
> - SITUATIONAL AWARENESS
> - HIGH/BROAD-THINKING
> - STRONG CONTEXTUALIZING
> - CLARITY ON ACTION MODES (CYNEFIN)

Some basic skills for gravitons are number one is compassion, mindfulness, situational awareness, to understand what's going on to have really expansive thinking the ability to contextualize what's going on, and some clarity on action modes, which we'll get into in my second presentation, which will be number six in this series.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/hFQ8N65.png)

(00:08:01)    
This is a graphic, which explains it all in context. There's a lot going on here. Again this was developed with a view toward creating a DAO behind this, but these are all the different aspects of things that we're talking about in terms of gravitons. 

What's great about this is that we're actually going to be able to, as a graviton, you might feel drawn to one thing more than another. We will, we actually have book clubs around Ostrom's principles. We're gonna have a practice group and a book club around nonviolent communication. 

Those of you who are a bit more alternate distribution or dispute resolution and mediation, escalation, and eventually spinning up into the legal side of the picture, then you'll have these four different aspects to talk about. 

Primarily what I'd like to do is just cover them all in a broad way. Then talk specifically about the developmental thinking, how it can contextualize the rest of these things.

> ### Graviton's 'Unified Vision'
> Each of the four principles (A,B,C,D) is a tool to unify our thinking. Being Gravitons, our primary role is to think in unified ways when others cannot. Our role is to educate and expand our own and our group’s ability to remain unified against a variety of potential stimuli.
> 
> Using this lifelong learning and generative process (using the three approaches inside of our Graviton group- Curation, Moderation and Cross-Pollination) you can develop your ability to ‘see into’ the two general viewpoints of people divided by conflict. 

You'll notice that the four principles are ways of unifying. There are two hemispheres of the human brain. You have the left brain, which is the divided way of thinking, which is typical in the centralized world, the centralized corporate world, the centralized banking world. 

It's a very divided narcissistic approach to things where we externalize costs. There's an awful lot of the things that cryptocurrencies and token engineers are averse to in that universe. 

The whole point of being a graviton is to be able to heal things. You take the divided stuff and bring them back together. Each of these principles is a methodology for unifying, 

According to the different situations that we find ourselves in. Our primary role is to think in unified ways when other people cannot. 

Then the role is to educate and expand our group's ability to remain unified against a variety of potential stimuli that would seek to divide us. This is a lifelong learning process, and it's also very generative. 

I'll show you the generative almost cellular process that we're talking about with the curation moderation across pollination that you can develop in terms to see into the people who might be divided by conflict and to see through the situations that we find ourselves in. 

## Graviton Training

![](https://i.imgur.com/zwECDBf.png)

After this training, you guys should be able to do each one of these seven things. A huge part that we're gonna cover today around **separating people from problems** that's in many ways, **separating the feelings that people have from the needs (that the word problems is often used to represent)**. 

Also trying to make sure that you understand that each time we're talking about conflict, we need to talk about it in these three contexts that I was talking to you about within yourself, within the relationship that you're having in front of you, and then additionally to the larger community as a whole. 

One of the things you should be able to do as a graviton is to be able to identify those different contexts from each other. And like number three says, additionally promoting empathy between all of the conflicting parties with emotional intelligence with also with this understanding of basically in many ways, this is a setting of expectations, what we're talking about now.  

Also this presentation is intended to give you the different tools in the context, in which to understand yourselves and the three contexts that we're talking about. 

Additionally there are just some plain old regulations that we have to adhere to with respect to terms and conditions, codes of conduct the graduated sanctions. 

There are other legal obligations that we have. Those things would all be addressed in the larger context of the overall community and in many ways, the world.

## Value-Aligned Conduct

> The TEC operates from a *prosocial*, *human centered* perspective:
> 
> * **Prosocial** - We value designs that create public goods over profit. Profit is not bad, on the contrary, it is critical towards our goal of creating a regenerative economy that supports the Token Engineering community, but providing services to support the TE community is more important than making a profit.
> 
> * **Human centered** - We encourage initiatives that are focused on using token engineering in an ethical manner, and strive to only create positive impact.

The TEC, we have a value aligned code of conduct. The TEC operates from prosocial principles. 

It's also very important for other communities to try to frame their themselves between principles and a judgment made by a group of people, but by some principles associated to the values that of the organization. Good over profit. 

Profit is not bad. On the contrary, it is critical towards our goal of creating economy that support the token in the engineering community, but providing services to support the TE community is more important than making a profit. 

Also we are human centered. We encourage initiatives that are and strive to only create positive impact.  

### We hold ourselves to high standards of safety, resilience, and integrity:

* *Safety* - Everyone should feel safe to be, interact and express their opinions and contributions free from any malicious reaction.  
* *Resilience* - We ask members of this community to communicate openly and to make an effort to maintain alignment with the TEC vision, mission and values. If conflicts arise, we expect members to act peacefully towards a resolution and the restoration of harmony and efficiency. If needed,  Loie from the Commons Stack can facilitate a conflict resolution process.
* *Integrity* - Honesty and consistency lead to trust, which is a core value of healthy communities. Our approach is to trust first, and any instances of scam, mislead, spam or defraud will be treated as a violation of this code of conduct. 

(00:05:28)
We hold ourselves to high standards of safety, resilience, and express their opinions and contributions free from any malicious reaction resilience. We ask members of this community to communicate openly and to make an effort to maintain if conflict arises. 

We expect members to like peacefully towards a resolution and the restoration of harmony and efficiency. Integrity, honesty and consistency lead to trust, which is a core value of healthy communities. 

### We encourage our members to be radically open source, non-hierarchical, creative, transparent in their intentions and accountable for their actions

> * *Open source* - Ideas are meant to be shared. We default to using GPLv3 and Creative Commons with attribution licensing on our work, but we accept all open source licenses. 
> * *Non-hierarchical* - Everyone is encouraged to exercise their autonomy, creativity and full agency when acting in the Commons. Every individual is wise in their own manner and the diversity of perspectives enriches our Commons. 
> * *Transparent* - We value individuals' efforts to act transparently, and to proactively identify their incentives, especially if there are conflicts of interest, especially when it comes to proposing, funding, work progress and other important activities involving the TE Commons.
> * *Accountable* - Community members are expected to be accountable for all their actions and commitments. Accountability brings trust and trusting in each other is critical for our success. 

Our approach is to trust first and any instance of scam, misleading spam, or fraud will be treated as a violation of this code of conduct. 

Why did I take the time to read all these? Because sometimes we like forget our values, and it's very important to understand that here is not like what one person says is that we have these values and in, within our values, we are talking about, about accepting the difference about respecting each other about being value driven about being a human centered. 

These are like the basis and the basic understanding that we are going to try to reproduce in every interaction of the TEC. 

### We are value driven, (not profit driven) and will strive to support token engineering projects that appreciate the value of public goods and ethical, inclusive economic systems.

That's why it's really important for gravitons not only to understand these values, but also to replicate them and to behave according to them in their role that is very aligned and very associated to community management. 

The role of easing communication is also very related to the community management. That is why I am really happy to say that the new discord that we are going to migrate to is going to be moderated by gravity and by gravitons, and with the help of transparency. 

### What actions can be taken in this medium?

> * Gravitons can submit conflicts or issues to the Gravity Registry, that is a database of the cases managed by gravity.
> * Conflict resolution calls and chats are closed to Gravitons and parties involved to respect privacy and vulnerability. 
> * The Gravity working group can host training and capacitate individuals to become Gravitons.
> * The Gravity training is free and open for all. 
> * Gravity can remove proposals from all the voting categories if they receive flaggins and/or are seen as harmful for the community based on our rules, boundaries, T&C’s and Code of Conduct.   


It's very important that the members of these groups are also a reflection. Also that they lead with the example of acting according to these values, because it wouldn't have any sense to have graviton that don't follow the code of conduct of the organization.

Instead of that, to be a graviton, we will have additional requirement different to the requirements of the normal members in the organization. What are the additional requirements that we have in the gravity code of conduct?  

We decided to make this approximation to a code of conduct for the different platforms that we use, what Ostrom says that is that sometimes we don't include what is required when we are making rules. We only make rules thinking on what is allowed and what is forbidden. 

Here we tried also to add an important thing of what is required to join and stay in the collective. What actions can be taking in gravity, everyone in the community can fill the gravity type form or approach any of the gravity to request support for conflict and any sort of support or on the side situations. 

In case of conflict, gravitons can approach the parties involved to collect information on the issues. Graviton can take actions to regulate unwanted behavior. According to the graduated sanctions, all community members can propose new methodologies to approach graduated sanctions and mutual monitoring, as well as a great current ones. 

Through advice process and forum voting gravity can submit conflicts or issues to the gravity registry. That is a database of the case managed by gravity conflict resolution calls and chats are closed to gravity and parties involved to respect privacy and vulnerability. 

The gravity working group can host trainings and capacitating individuals to become gravity. The gravity training is free and open for all. Gravity can remove proposals from all the voting categories, if they receive flaggings or are seen as harmful for the community, based on our rules, boundaries terms, and conditions and code of conduct.  

### Now what are the requirements and what is discouraged or forbidden? 

> #### Is this action or outcome required?
> - All members should act in acknowledgment of the [guidelines for scale of conflict and graduated sanctions](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/scale-of-conflicts-graduated-sanction-guideline/234)
> - Gravitons should comply to the code of conduct of the TEC and the additional [Graviton Code of Conduct](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/gravity-role-design/174) 
> - Gravitons should accept cases based on their competence and communicate to the Gravity group if they don’t feel capable of handling an issue. 
> - Gravitons should promote trust and good relationships between the community

> - Respect the arrangements made about the situations issued
> 
> #### Is this action or outcome discouraged? 
> 
> - Using the confidential Gravity information to serve personal interest (that leads to expulsion of the Gravity group)
> - Violating the requirements for the [Graviton Role](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/gravity-role-design/174) (Any member can monitor Gravitons actions and report to other Gravitons, fill in the typeform, or contact community stewards.

The requirements are that all members should act in acknowledgement of the guidelines for a scale of conflict and graduated sanctions that will go over them in a moment. 

Graviton should comply to the code of conduct to of the TEC and the additional graviton code of conduct graviton should accept case cases based on their competence and communicate to the gravity working group. 

If they don't feel capable of having an issue, graviton should promote trust and good relationship between the community. It is required to complete. The graviton will update the gravity registry with the information of possible agreement. 

All members should commit to respect the protocol for TEC calls and respect the arrangements made about the situations issued. These are like the rules that we are going to follow in in gravity.  

We all are making this training to become Gravitons and no one can become a Graviton without being in this training. I think that we will need some, some like new roadmap to integrate some of the new ideas that graviton that you can can have for improving this training and for improving this program. 

The idea of all that is that when we have this organization made, we can then go out and offer our services to other organizations. 

What is discouraged in for gravity, using confidential gravity information to serve personal interest that will lead to expulsion from the gravity group, and because any member can monitor gravity actions and report to other gravity feel in the type form or contact community steroids, and like the gravitons as all of the members of the organization are engaged in this mutual monitoring. 

Gravitons can also be reported to another graviton or to be at a type form or contacting another community steward for telling some behavior or unwanted behavior that the graviton is producing or any conflict that may involve a graviton.  

### Protocol for TEC meetings - Common rules for all calls:

> - *Nonviolent communication is the common rule* (assertive, careful language)
> - *Humbleness of knowledge* (not trying to impose own perspective)
> - Respect the *moderation* (The moderator can stop interventions if considered)
> - Respect to the *time and topics of the agenda*
> - Respect the *others integrity*
> - Spamming/sabotage leads to *retire* from call
> - Open mics while presentations can be *server muted*
> - Participants can use *different languages* for comfortably expressing ideas.

As I was saying before, it is really good that now gravity has a moderation powers, because that will help us to respect the protocol of the TEC meetings. It's very important that we have like clear rules so that anyone is lost, or that if anyone is new to the community, they can like get engaged where we behave the community. 

Because here we have to take in mind that this is our workplace, and there are certain boundaries on what can be published in the discord. Also there are certain boundaries of what can we do in a call because most of our calls are being recorded and streamed. It's very important that we keep order in our calls. 

We're to turn off any mic, if like the tone of the discussion is going too strong, or even if open mics are an open mic. It's good for the moderators to be able to server mute someone to looking for the quality of the call and quality of the sound. 

These are like the ground rules for the interactions that we have in polls. We have non-violent communication is the common rule and grateful to our members and to our co colleagues. That's why we give praise. It's good always to respect. 

We don't like using any like nicknames or something like that. We it's always good to ask someone, how do you like to be called. We promote humbleness of knowledge because here in these communities, we all are experts. We all are very competent people that has a lot of knowledge and a lot of wisdom in them. 

Instead of trying to impose our own perspective into the community, we want is to enrich the community with the diversity of knowledge that we all can bring.  

The idea is not to spend time in calls on topics that are not for the purpose of that call. If we want to discuss something, it's good to like schedule a other members work, we have to respect others and integrity. 

This is very aligned to what we are trying to say of valuing everyone and respecting the dignity of each member. These are also rules related to the community management in different platforms and like spamming and sabotage leads to retire from the call. 

If this is happening in a repetitive way, the user may be retired from the server. This is another thing that is encouraged is that as we are a community from, with people from all over the world, sometimes we can feel more comfortable expressing certain ideas in our native language. 

Even though that we communicate in English for like our main language to communicate, if there is a word or an expression that I don't know how to say in English, maybe I can use and talk in Spanish and other member can help me to express because the idea that even though that we have language barriers here, we can ease the communication for everyone.

Going deeper into gravity participation in community management, TEC has its own tailored rules and boundaries, which are co-created and translated into protocols, processes, and guidelines that are made to follow our values, take care of our systems and regulate autonomously. 

In gravity, we are proposing a mutual monitoring system with, or with a direct communication to the following responsibility as a need, as individuals to promote dialogue within the organization of sanctions and both a collective and individuals to in our community practice.

> 4. Hold admin powers to manage systems of communication (Discord, Telegram, Forum, CV App) on behalf of the individual, the constituent groups and the community as a whole.
> 5. Promote community resilience and long-lasting human relationships by proactively co-creating boundaries, discussion and exchange in a system of shared values.
> 6. As a group, take decisions regarding the implementation of graduated sanctions and commit to its participation with respect to all individuals, specially the ones that don’t follow to our terms and conditions.

What is our goal? The goal of gravity is that people in the community recognize the agreements and culturally act coherently with the values of the organization. If there is conflict, there are clear steps to follow in order to manage the situation for defected search and implementation of solutions that respect the dignity of all parts involved.  

It's very important to understand that this is something that are able to offer ways to solve some of the challenges brought up by the activities that we are involved in, like coordination activities, decision making activities, it's very important that we have clear steps to follow up, to manage the situations that may arise.

Conflict, as we have seen in past sessions is a natural possibility in life. 

We should be able to understand the possible conflicts that may arise within the activities that we are involved in and within the media that we communicate through. 

Then we can suggest actions for improving or for correcting that unwanted behavior. 

The gravity group aims to work the group aims to support the TEC by actively promoting trust setting expectations and managing conflict between individuals, the different groups and the community as a whole recognize boundaries and areas of potential dispute as well as explicit violations of boundaries between individual and the community; supporting communication between community members and encouraging participation at all levels individually in groups and inside the community as a whole; hold admin powers to manage systems of communication on behalf of the co groups and proactively promote boundaries discussions and exchange, and as a group take decisions regarding the implementation of, and commit to its participation with respect to all individuals, especially ones that don't follow and understand. 

Yeah, the idea instead of that, is that contract that don't follow our conditions can be correct it in order to prepare the harm done and think the same way that we do with respect and with value of their dignity. we, it would be on coherence that we would make that what idea, what we are doing is to  

(00:29:58)

Session that she said about how rules can be also for forgiving. Rules that we are trying to apply within the organization are not like punishing rules. 

In the next session I want to go like really in the detail of what our suggested graduate sanctions, but most of them are not any punishment. Most of them involve love, swarming with love, that is a sanction instead of having to pay a due or something a sanction can be a reasonable action to manage that conflict can be trying to engage him or her in other activities that may make her, or him feel more valued. Sanctions that we are proposing are very, like from the point of view of reconciliation and healing.
