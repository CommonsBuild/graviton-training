## What I've Learned so Far in Gravity (s2e5 Loie)
(00:18:10)    
**Ashley**:    Yes, it is. It's been a while since I've seen you. It's great to see you and I'm glad that you're here. I'm doing pretty good today. It's been a busy day and my brain has been in a lot of places, but it's nice to actually talk and check in. Yeah. What I've learned so far in gravity, the biggest thing that I've taken away from this is, and you touched on it in one of your slides.

These conflicts that are coming up in our communities are actually like gifts and ways that we can evolve and connect with one another more and get to probe these situations so that we can learn from them rather than just dissolving conflict right away actually using it as a tool to make our communities better. I don't know if better is the right word, but more cohesive  I will pass it to Tam.  

(00:19:23)    
**Tom**:    Hey, I'll also keep it quick. Hey, everyone, what I've learned is that there's so much interest in nonviolent communication and managing complex, and there's a lot of really passionate people in the TEC. It's amazing to see everyone here week after week, and I'll pass to Jean.  

(00:19:43)    
**Jean**:    Thank you. Ma'am yeah, I've learned specifically that rhetoric is obviously critical, but to reassess our perceptions of our own rhetoric regularly and try to understand its origins and what it implies about ourselves and our word choice and the way that we select what we're gonna say and how that conveys more about us than we perceive or believe regularly, I'll pass it to, I wishes.  

(00:20:27)    
**Aloysious**:    I wish just, I use them pronouns and my part's ING. I'm having an anxiety attack right now. It's not a bad thing. I'm autistic. I got really excited about what I was hearing, what I was hearing about the people and how there used to be people and the hierarchy and structures. Now there needs to be a process, just got my heart racing. Cause I feel like I pride myself at, to sleep at night knowing that's the thing that we need and them hearing that thing about it needs to be personal. 

I know the answer is documenting workflows and processes cuz like I know that's how I made organizations work in the government and I just don't see it happening here. It helps with continuity and all I want is collaboration and mentorship to be part of the process in DAOs spaces. Like that's the piece that I'm hearing and the fun and the documentation is mentorship and fun ways of documenting your processes instead of making them like boring and streamlined. That's my check in, I'm like all over the place, thinking about those topics. 

I am also a bit scattered today and very happy to be here. The nugget that really is sticking with me the most from the graviton training is conflict being a gift and conflict being yeah, a really good thing and a crucial part of community and really reorienting towards that way of looking at things. Yeah, that's all with me for now. I will pass it to Lauren.  

(00:22:39)    
**Lauren**:    Oh cool. Nice. What I learned in gravity? Well, I like everybody's check-ins are like really broad concept things. I was thinking of something very specific that I learned that I thought was really cool was this Maslow's hierarchy of needs thing and how like job dissatisfaction is associated with like your basic needs your safety needs not being met. Then job satisfaction is based on like your growth needs being able to be met. That's really interesting and cool. Like all the conflicts that come up are that I observe coming up are often like really simple things, like unclear work agreements or like compensation related and then, but yeah, it's like when everybody's feeling like support and uplifted forward, that's like where the satisfaction comes from. 

(00:23:46)    
**Morgan**:    My name is Morgan. I use their own pronouns. What I'm learning is just a, this is the first time that I've been in DAO space and I'm learning through relationships with you all and the collective invitation to lean into conflict as like a regenerative process. I'm so grateful for all of the creative frameworks that allow us to codevelop based off of that understanding. 

(00:24:41)    
**Forest**:    Hi there. This is Forst. I've definitely, I've been very passionate about communication and conflict resolution for a long time. This has really shown me how much interest and passion there is in bringing this to yeah. This industry decentralized spaces and also like larger organizations. It's really uplifting to see.  

(00:26:48)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I, what I learned from this is that you always continue learning and it's not like a skill that you got once and you have it for the rest of your life, but it's something like it's a living practice of every day being on top of the crazy horse that is in your mind and I'll pass to  

(00:27:21)    
**Speaker 6**:    Hi. Thank you. What I've learned. The fact that in those new, the kind in that in those new organizations, you can actually bring yourself as a person. Not only your skills or not only what you're capable of doing, but you can bring yourself and not only just the way it is, but also within a learning mindset, by going into the relationship with other people, by meeting other people, you learn and you open up that space, that is you, your identity, open it up to other people and you going to this process together and I love that. Just you just the way you are. Then in the learning mindset, I bringing that and being welcomed for that. I really, and I pass it on to, let's see a temp, 

(00:28:48)    
**Speaker 10**:    For me, the largest learnings iPad so far is the actual realization of why super conflict arise. Just the reasons why behind it. I like have chance to understand things that happened in the DAOs. I'm part of better from a why and abstracted from the actual person and really just UN taking a step back and understanding that again, conflict could be used to also drive change and really that for me, what came out most, and I hope it's not too loud in the background.  

(00:29:49)    
**Speaker 6**:    I can take it next. Well, first it was a really good surprise to see Dominic. I met him in Rio. It was the first nonviolent communication speech I went in my life. I was quite young and I never knew his name. Then you showed now, and then I could see it, oh, is this guy? And he said something that was so impactful to me, that was violence is born from the choices we didn't know we could make. That, it's such a simple and profound phrase that resonates so much with me very often and something, we've been learning a lot in gravity is how this is a meeting space for like us to see that we have much more in common that we could imagine. Also for being an entry point to the, that space, which is yeah, really beautiful. Also conflict transformation is just everything we need that I'm based in Brazil. Now it's almost every day that there are protests outside of the building and it is just, we're getting to a point where we really need solutions. I appreciate all of you being in this room right now and I'll pass to my  

(00:31:43)    
**Speaker 12**:    Great. Thanks. The thing that I've been learning is the methodologist and the different approaches and also specifically about rebuilding trust within dos. That is very nice as I see it as a constant and common thing within all the communities and also like obviously in any type of community, but within this digital space, it is really nice to have like some steps to guide, but not to follow us put on a stone, but to have us inspiration, then adapt them. Then us as this constant learning graviton be ready to adapt them. Thank you very much.  

(00:32:45)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Okay. Nick, have you gone?  

(00:32:51)    
**Nick**:    I have not. I, sorry. I was, I'm having a lot of troubles with my stream right now, but I was just gonna say that one of the there's been so many things that have been absorbing from this graviton course that I've really appreciated the presenters and the different perspectives from a few of the conversations we've had. I just the biggest thing I'm taking away is that there are organizations like this, that there are organizations of people that are attempting to build these kinds of accountability, processes and restoration processes together decentralized without one single person running the show. I just, I love that. I'm excited to learn more. I don't know who else to pass it to. I'm so sorry that I've been having such wifi trouble. If someone could help me next, 

(00:33:42)    
**Speaker 6**:    I'll jump in. I've gosh, so much has stuck with me. A big thing is the NVC. I joined the book club and also last week's talk. It's just really incredible having a huge paradigm about how we relate to each other. Then also how we interpret those relations. I've been mulling a lot over that and it really has been powerful, not just in the DAO space, but also in so many other aspects of life. I don't know who else to call on next.  

(00:34:27)    
**Loie**:    We've had it Thomas, a healthy, random checkins. Okay. Thomas. Cool. I'll say, if people don't wanna check in too. That's okay. After Thomas, I'll just ask if there's anyone else that's like feeling really called to say something. Go ahead, Thomas.  

(00:34:51)    
**Speaker 13**:    Right. Jab. That's what stuck with me from this rapid training is more like how we must train the ability to listen to people no matter if we are in opposite sides and conflict, but especially if you want to be mediating a space, both for DAOs space or formation spaces. That's ability that twin must try to improve and always emulate people to pray and adapt. I don't know who else is who else is from the checking? Yes, it suits. Thank you.  

(00:36:02)    
**Speaker 15**:    Yeah, no problem. Thank you. The thing that I've really learned from so far from gravity is that how much of a need conflict resolution it has within all communities and as individuals being prepared to mitigate conflict and not just be reactive towards conflict, but be to be anticipatory and learn how to look at conflict from different lenses, whether it be from non-violent communication or from a connecting framework or just having more empathy in terms of dealing with people within decentralized organizations is very valuable and something that we take for granted in our traditional systems. So being able to look at it and come together as a group and have this positive feedback loop on the knowledge that we're all sharing around this issue is really important. Something that I didn't realize until the till I saw how many people showed up to these graviton trainings. It's very exciting. I will pass it to I'll say next person ju up.  

(00:37:23)    
**Loie**:    And if, sure, how many people we have in here versus how many have gone, but yeah, I'll just give a minute now. Is there anyone else who would like to still, 

(00:37:39)    
**Speaker 4**:    Yeah, I can share my name is luck and I use say them pronouns. I wishes invited me into this training, and this is only the second week I've come. Definitely still like under getting to understand like what this space is, but I really liked, I watched one of the videos that was posted in the chat by the same person that you shared the video of. I love what they said about like wanting to create rooms for conflict creating literal spaces that are designated in the way that we have like a bedroom designated for rest. Cuz we anticipate that's a need. We're gonna have like creating rooms and processes and agreements around conflict because we know it's something that we're gonna encounter and not something to avoid. I thought that was a cool learning from today and it's yeah. Great to be here. Thank you.  

(00:38:42)    
**Speaker 4**:    Hi. I can jump in really quick. I just wanna say that I feel that what I've been learning most is that it's not just about how we feel like how I feel personally, but it's also about like how the other gets the impression, what I've been saying. It's like the community it's important. We wanna be heard, but we also need to listen and also be careful about like how we say it. Like we are learning that on the book that we are reading and I had other things to say too, but I feel contemplated for everyone that I read before me.
