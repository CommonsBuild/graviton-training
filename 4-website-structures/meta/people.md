## Juan Carlos

**Juan Carlos**:
I am going to start telling a bit about myself. I studied two years of philosophy and then I moved to political sciences and then I started specialization in sustainable development, then in environmental law. Then I study a Masters in conflict management. 

I am very passionate of studying conflict and I have found it to be something that can be applied in our everyday life and in our organizations. 

(01:01:50)
**Juan Carlos**:  I want to share with you like my personal experience. I had a restaurant like five years ago and the restaurant was going good. But I felt that if I stood, like with that restaurant, I wasn't going to like, achieve all of my goals. When I decided to close that restaurant, it was a big conflict for me because I decided it to start doing other, other things.  

(01:03:13)
**Juan Carlos**:    And I didn't have like that economical sustain that the restaurant gave me. It was really hard for me, but right now I can see that conflict that I had as a gift, because that has brought me to enter into the academic world in universities, and also to be entering here in this, in, in this, the community.

## LOIE

(00:01:38)    
Welcome to those of you who are pinging in just now, I'm Loie. I have been really interested in conflict resolution since I was a teenager, really. Back when I was about 19, I got involved with a restorative justice group in Seattle and actually was able to help found the first restorative justice organization in my city, where we took cases of young adults out of the criminal justice system and offered them to divert into this process. 

That's essentially more like a healing talking circle and that was super valuable experience for me and ever since I started studying and working with them in my community, I became known as a conflict resolution person and my community called upon me in some pretty intense ways to draft up accountability processes. 

I ended up traveling up and down the west coast for some of the conflicts that I was dealing with gathering case notes and connecting victims. Conflict resolution has always been really important to me. 

It comes from my family systems as well. As a child being a smoother over of things. I'm a mediator and yeah, this is just a super big part of my heart and my life and what I offer to the world. I feel like I'm just constantly learning about it and there's no way to really ever become an expert. 

## Durgadas

> What I have learned from him as a person that has a Masters in Conflict Management is that sometimes we focus on addressing conflict when it arises, but it's also very important to prevent conflict and to understand that the conflicts are, are not an expression of duality, but also an expression of our inner self - JuanC

(00:02:53)
**Durgadas**:    My relationship with conflict, this is a discussion that Juan and I had just before coming into this training, just to talk a little bit about.. we are a group of people coming together to promote the resilience in the decentralized organization. 

> The idea is that I'm trying to bring to the table as a way to address conflict both within yourself and then within the community, then in the larger context of all the different communities you might be connecting with

I'm sure that decentralized organizations and communities have certain social sectors, which are different from let's say corporations and other things. We need to have some unified approach to that. 

My initial proposition to you, **I'm gonna explain this conflict resolution in three stages.** I'll tell you about myself and how I have addressed conflict _within myself_. 

Then the second part is how I went from my own inner conflicts to dealing with those in my relationships, both _with society_ as a whole, and within my _individual relationships_. 

Then I'll give a "theory of everything"  to contextualize, we find ourselves in different conflictual situations in a very large context. Speaking for myself, I'm somebody who is 52 years old. 

#### Individual
I'm a lifelong second generation geek who grew up playing hangman on a punch card mainframe. My dad was a computer programmer for a Cobal programmer for Citibank.  

I've literally been in tech since I was probably six years old. More than that, being on the autism spectrum and not learning about it until I was in my forties meant that I had a lot of conflict in my life because I was constantly bullied for thinking differently and behaving differently according to society. 

Eventually I had a bit of an crisis and gave up everything I owned and went and lived in an ashram trying to become a swami. 

I basically spent a long time (as far as spiral dynamics colors, this is my green period) where I went into a community, except it was an Ashram that was like an intentional community.

Not a digital intentional community like this one, but more like a place where we all live together. I got to understand for myself a lot better. 

### Societal

Then, then I started trying to figure out what it is that I needed to do within society and how to address my relationship with society. But I didn't really know enough about myself.

> What we're gonna actually talk today with respect to this community is to combine the models of _non-violence_ / _compassionate communication_ with _spiral dynamics_. 
> 
> Later on, we'll evolve into some other theories of transformational conflict, why is it that we're doing all this, with respect to how to create good boundaries and expectations and other things. 
> 
> All of this relates also back to Ostrom's principles in particular four or five and six, if you're familiar with our work.  

This is all actually to be credited to the folks who started all this, that we were gonna do this cultural build to start with, because it is so valuable to have a real understanding behind everything that we're doing. 

I'm hoping that this contextualizing information can help you personally, within the conflict that we all tend to have it in each each person, and then how to manage conflicts interpersonally, and then to see the approach that the overall community is taking toward the creation of trust. 

Then the back side of that around the creation of trust is often what do we do when those boundaries and expectations are not met and how do we deal with them? So I hope that's a decent introduction for me.  

One further thing I'll say is once I left the ashram, I founded a couple of nonviolent communication groups, and I'm also participating weekly spiral dynamics meeting on Wednesdays at 5:00 PM. There'll be links to that in the, that I've put into the presentation. 

(01:11)    
**Durgadas**:    Okay, so I'm just gonna start. This is the very first real presentation I've done on all this. I've spent the last 10 or so years gathering this information and particularly in the last five years. Some of that comes from the fact that I started about that time to work at a native band. Simultaneously my wife, who is, who has a gold medal in the Commonwealth games is civil medal in the pan am games in a bronze medal in the Olympic games was basically chased out of her teaching profession due to racism. So the combination of those two things along with the election of Donald Trump, which brought up the post-traumatic stress from my own narcissistic father, who is functionally identical to him, and all of these things created this tension within me a bit.  

(02:15)    
**Durgadas**:    Like we talk about spiral dynamics where there's this real desire to understand what's going on. Simultaneously I was in a yellow period. If any of you guys know about SPR dynamics. Basically I applied myself to that problem and realized that really at the end of the day, being that I may essentially a privileged white guy in this world with surrounded by oodles of technology. I have an enormous opportunity to subvert my privilege if I can just understand what it is. I'm also on the autism spectrum and have suffered for many years from just thinking differently, according to the culture that we live in. Basically everybody on this call probably suffers in some way from that, regardless of who they are or what they look, because it's the nature of the culture itself. So my thought about what to do about that was that I basically needed to accept responsibility for this.  

My name's Regis Chapman, you can call me Durga dos. I spent 10 years building this building. You kind see behind me, it's all made outta mud and clay and straw and fantastic. I, so I'm also working with some of the other people on this call in various capacities, Sean, with his cryptocurrency company, grace, we're working together on trying to talk about autism together. 

### Durgadas Story
What you basically have to do is in my case, I was offered a physics scholarship to Notre Dame when I came out of high school. 

I had been bullied for so long, by so many different people in so many different schools, I just said, I can't possibly ever go to another school. The physics professor himself was gonna pay for my education. I don't know if you understand how much money that is even back in the eighties, but that's hundreds of thousands of dollars to go to an Ivy league school Notre Dame. Right. 

He was gonna pay that because he talked to me on the phone for 15 minutes. Why didn't I wanna do that? That's because I understood that there was something that was really wrong with the educational system. I couldn't put myself into that situation. 

put myself into that situation again and continue to be bullied and continue to be worked on by this thing. What did i do is i came out of that and i found that i could be a lifelong learner and then i could validate myself and then i could i could figure out who i was. 

That continued right up until i was 32 years old when i decided i was going to leave my my father's uh strategy to become rich and suddenly uh uh leave silicon valley and stop working 100 hours a week to uh try to to get the brass ring and instead i was going to go and learn myself and what happened to me was that i just became very sick of myself i became very sick of the entire the entire load it just felt like the whole culture was just kind of crapping on me the whole time and i just didn't know myself enough to be able to to turn and face it and to be able to understand what was going on 

that's why self-knowledge is so important that's why self-compassion is so important that's why being able to turn and face and look at this stuff and you can't do it unless you know who you are and that's why over and over if you look at all of my quora answers i say find a teacher learn yourself and let me know if i can help those are the three things that i always talk about and self-knowledge is the single most important thing in life and it will
always be that way

### Irene

Hello everybody. I am a therapist and I work with trauma, and the modality that I use is called Somatic Experiencing. I also have a bit of sensory motor approach and hakomi approach and polyvagal. I work this way because I have found, from my own experience, that when you address experience in the body is where things really can be different. 

When I tried talk therapy, nothing changed. In trauma specifically, it's not mental only thing, it's an experience that it's imprinted in the body. That's why I like this modality so much because of their effectiveness in the, in changing the experience. Yes, that's about it. 

### David 

I've been in the blockchain space for like four since like 2017. That's also coincided with my personal recovery from alcoholism and drug abuse. In that time I've just done tons of study into just changing my awareness and changing my frame of mind, how and live. 

Nonviolent Communication has been a really important part of that for me. It's a really useful framework, not just as a communication style practice that can be really beneficial, but even just understanding the principles behind it, that we take ownership of our feelings and we get clear about our needs and these things are just really healthy for our emotional intelligence, our emotional life, and how we interact with people on a day to day. I'm also very in into psychology, generally speaking. 

Specifically lately I've been into ifs internal family systems, EMDR, neurolinguistic programming (NLP), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and really getting down to what are the mental models that we can take from psychology that are people really need in today's world to know themselves better. Then what are the practices that are really game changing to have the most positive, optimal state of mind so we can do the things that we wanna do.  


### Marcelo

(13:23)    
**Marcelo**:    Thank you. I'm Marcelo Tavaris. I'm a professor at University of Brazil, and I'm a clinical psychologist. I've been working with suicide prevention and crisis intervention for some time now. I feel like I have a passion for working with people who have come to this situation where suffering becomes unbearable and something must happen or must some change, significant change in life is necessary for them to go on. 

It's incredible experience when you can see these people connecting with life again, reconnecting with themselves, with their own experience. It's personally also an experience that enriches my life personally. It's something that keeps me going as well. 

Not just that, the idea of helping people but a person gaining from it. As a professor, I also have personal connection with the process of witnessing people, learning to understand more about how we function in everyday lives as to make life better for us, for ourselves and for others. That's what keeps me going.  

### Angie

**Angie**:    Hi everybody, I'm Angie. I'm from Mexico and I am a part of the communications team in Token engineering. I also share with Bianca this space in Gravity where we have this monthly event called Mental health, Take care of your Mind, which is a safe space for people to come and express themselves and help them in any way we can. 

I wanted to share that every community member should be prepared to how to respond or even help someone in crisis in the most appropriate way. Because every word that comes out of one's mouth can have a profound effect on someone. 

It's important we are all in a positive and safe environment and make people feel like they can ask for help openly and without feeling like a burden or judged. We have a series of questions to ask our special guests.
