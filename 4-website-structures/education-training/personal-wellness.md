  - [Polarity Integration](http://worldtrans.org/TP/TP1/TP1-109.HTML) 
    > Polarity Integration is based on the principle that, if one fixates on one way of being, one is also creating the opposite way of being. An unwanted way of being or doing is likely to be the flip side of a wanted way of being or doing. If the person doesn't take responsibility for both sides she will have created an ongoing conflict between them. The solution is to encompass both sides and integrate them as necessary.

The body whispers, talks and then screams for you to stop. The "blocks" we have on our way are the most loving part of ourselves telling us that is not the way, this makes us return to our true selves.

### Meaning Crisis
- [Meaning Crisis Collection - An indepth collection of notes and transcripts pertaining to Dr. John Vervaeke's Meaning Crisis](https://www.meaningcrisis.co)
  > We are in the midst of a mental health crisis. There are increases in anxiety disorders, depression, despair, suicide rates are going up in North America, parts of Europe, other parts of the world. And that mental health crisis is itself due to and engaged with crises in the environment and the political system. And those in turn are immeshed within a deeper cultural historical crisis. I called the meeting crisis. So the meaning crisis expresses itself and many people are giving voice to this in many different ways, is this increasing sense of bullshit. Bullshit is on the increase. It's more and more pervasive throughout our lives and there's this sense of drowning in this old ocean of bullshit. And we have to understand why is this the case and what can we do about it? So today there is an increase of people feeling very disconnected from themselves, from each other, from the world, from a viable and foreseeable future.

Our brains, therefore, are designed not just to hunt and gather, but also to help us get ahead socially, often via deception and self-deception. But while we may be self-interested schemers, we benefit by pretending otherwise. The less we know about our own ugly motives, the better - and thus we don't like to talk or even think about the extent of our selfishness.
