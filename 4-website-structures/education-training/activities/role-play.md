  > Many educational theorists believe that learning is context-dependent. In other words, the nature of a student’s learning depends on the context in which the learning takes place. From this perspective, authentic activities—or learning activities that re-create as closely as possible the key dynamics and challenges of real-world activities—are critical to making learning relevant.

  > But what does it mean to make a negotiation exercise “authentic”? One approach is to select exercises in which the parties, issues, and factual contexts replicate as closely as possible the negotiations with which participants are familiar. This is most easily done with a relatively homogenous participant group-for instance, litigation attorneys, middle-school teachers, environmental activists, financial services sales representatives, or congressional representatives—who are likely to share some common negotiation experiences.\

  > In the January 2013 issue of Negotiation Journal, George Mason University professor Daniel Druckman and Creighton University Law School professor Noam Ebner discuss the benefits and drawbacks of simulations as a learning tool. Reviewing social science research, they find that engaging in simulations improves students’ motivation and retention of key concepts that have already been taught in lectures and classroom discussions. Thus, classes that combine simulations with more traditional classroom methods may maximize learning.\

### Org Design - Break Out Groups

(00:17:18)    
**Anna Marie**:    Let's jump into the practical. What I'm gonna do is share in the chat two different scenarios, and we're gonna break into breakout rooms in groups around four to five, and you're gonna have about 20 minutes as a group to explore these two scenarios.  

As you look at the scenarios, the suggestion is to imagine a situation that perhaps you already experience in a DAO or any organization or an experience that you've had in a previous organization and using the wisdom that we all have, that we gather from our time in communities and organizations to just explore there's no right or wrong answers here. 

It's just about what, from our own experiences, what can we bring to these two examples? The first one that I'm sharing here is about creating spirals into and out of positions of greater responsibility.

#### The first scenario is about creating spirals into and out of positions of greater responsibility

Some examples that might help your thinking is something along the lines of could use rituals of honoring and appreciation. 

Might you want to bring in timebound roles? Could you consider having advisor roles that people can step into? Could you have supported hiatus or off boarding periods for members and clear processes for how someone can do that? 

Would you perhaps implement knowledge sharing tools that make sure that information is passed over from members stepping out of a position of greater responsibility? Those are just some examples. 

#### The second scenario

It's really up to you as a group to choose which one you think is of greatest interest. 

This is creating various pathways for inclusion, participation and autonomy. Here, some examples that might help you is the idea of having groups of various sizes, having clear internal information pathways, time bound roles, having maximum group sizes, setting up what some people call pods or crews, which are small groups of not more than seven that might meet up regularly and form intimate bonds, facilitated spaces for a difficult conversation, such as power hierarchy, social capital, gender, and inclusion. 

Lastly, what about spaces for, in the calls for reflection and contemplation? As we put you into the rooms, say the chat will stay up. You get to choose as a group, which one you'd like to dive into, I'd ask that someone is chosen or office to volunteer as a note taker to jot down what are some of the ideas that you come up with. When we come back together, we'll share them with each other.
