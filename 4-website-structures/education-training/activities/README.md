  > Disentanglement Theory is an attempt to get to the bottom of things, The real bottom, and then heal it. It requires courage, patience, empathy, love, strength, and intuition. It builds emotional intelligence, your sense of love for yourself and the world, deeper happiness, and a generally pretty chillin’ vibe. It’s sweet.

## CONTINUE THE GRAVITON PATH

## Proposed situations

1. A DAO is debating on how to better govern itself. A part of the community thinks that there should be a small group of 5 to 10 core contributors having leadership roles, and other part of the community thinks that decentralized projects don't need to have a closed leadership. How to foster collective wisdom?

**Proposed tool:** _Centralization vs Decentralization:_ Deep Democracy debate and polarity mapping 

2. You designed a proposal for a DAO along with some colleagues, the proposal was funded and when you started working, frictions started arising. Some of the work was being delayed while the communication was getting worse with the team. The intended impact was not being achieved, and there is no intention of further funding for a continuation of the work being done. Besides looking for alternatives to continue contributing in the DAO, what to do with the relationships that were broken?

**Proposed tool:** _NVC practice:_ assertive communication, mediation.

3. You are loaded with work and you are failing to deliver some of the things that you were supposed to do. You notice that you are not being able to join some of the calls you normally like to participate, and you are leaving a bad impression with the people you were working with. You are not sleeping well and feeling a lot of pressure on your shoulders. You feel that you are blowing things even accidentally. What do you do now?

**Proposed tool:** _Mental health:_ Slow dojo. Communicational bridges and safe spaces. Mental health awareness.

4. You agreed to mediate in a case, and when you are in the first private meeting with one of the parties, they get hyper aroused and start getting triggered by strong emotions. Shortly you find yourself without control of the call, hearing that the mediation process wouldn’t make a difference and being in the position trying to manage and de escalate their reactions without revictimizing or undervaluing the feelings of the party. Your intention is to invite them to trust the mediation process and to have another private meeting, where hopefully, there could be some progress on getting information about what happened, setting a safe space for them to remain in their optimal arousal zone.

**Proposed tool:** _Trauma informed decisions - Harm reduction._

5. One of your teammates is often expressing a different point of view from the main voice that the group takes, The leader of the team thinks that their comments slows down the work, and start trying to avoid giving them space to talk in calls. Shortly after, gossip starts arising that the leader is imposing their ideas and other people in the team agrees with the silenced minority. What to do now?

**Proposed tool:** _Lowering the waterline - Including no voices_

6. A DAO started to fund to some contributors to make a pilot program inside their community. Shortly after the agreement was done, the market dropped 40% and core DAO contributors decided to strengthen financial priorities, cutting the funding to that project and not being able to implement the initial agreement. What to do now?

**Proposed tool:** _Escalation mechanisms - Expectation settings - Unexpected changes._

## Role Play

### Whose fault is it anyways? 

**Description**: you are working on a project in a DAO and you have been preparing for some months to make a public announcement about the release date of your next DeFi tool. Until some weeks ago, the planned date was set in July according to the initial roadmap. But **in last week's team call, one of the lead developers found a critical fail in the smart contracts that allowed re entrancy attacks**. 

It turns out that the **announcement got published on medium that same weekend, saying that the release date would be in July, without mentioning the critical bottleneck** in the smart contracts that could delay the release by a few months. In a public chat, contributors of the team start blaming each other for what happened. The rest of the DAO suggests that the writers and the publishing team has to take shared responsibility and propose alternatives to deal with the situation. 

What do you do now?  Part A: (Writer) Part B: (Publisher) Part C: (Lead dev)

Topics: Error culture. Shared responsibilities. Reconciliation.

## User stories - Conflict in Web 3
These user stories are based on real conflicts I have seen cause issues in crypto communities… it is not the small issues themselves that cause the issues, but the damage to the trust in the community members that slowly erodes as these small conflicts build and relationships in the community erode. Eventually this can cascade to the point where a small conflict explodes into members of the community not feeling safe.

- When people start fighting in the community sometimes moderators just pause on the chat and then a moderator can DM both people and ask them to chill… this is from Dulce  - Totally agree!

### Story #1 Copy-Fork

Alice created a really nice cadCAD model but it was not well promoted. Bob saw this model made very minor changes and submitted it to a TE Commons Hackathon and it took second place winning Bob $1000 and a lot of notoriety. Alice was hurt by this and asked Bob to give her credit and even part of the funds. Bob refused.  

Suggested approach: Alice reports the problem and asks for management in the situation. The third part -conflict manager(s), besides getting Alice’s point of view, (and reviewing its verity) should try to approach Bob and take notes about his justified point. After that, it would be possible to have an initial mapping of the problem, that describes -the most impartial way- what happened. If the description of the situation matches (gets the sign of both parts) there is a recognition of the legitimacy of the process and is the starting point to begin negotiating.

After the recognition of facts, we should start a process between parts. 
What is that Alice wants? She wants money and recognition, could she accept one of them?
What are the differences between bob’s and alice’s work? Why did bob had more impact?
What does bob want? What could bob gain about a good negotiation process? -Further work with alice? -even more recognition? How can we make this a win-win situation? -focusing on incentives rather than punishments.

After looking for solutions, If there is an agreement -or if there is no agreement at all-, (i suggest) this information could be hashed for legitimacy and access for both parts. That tells the story of the situation, if the conflict persists, there is a point to continue, and if a solution is reached, it could have kpi’s associated with accountability and progress of the situation. 
F/ex. Bob recognizes Alice’s work as a pioneer of his product, but does not give money. He agrees to respect peers' work in the ecosystem, and at 3-6 months, there is a review to see if bob has managed to diverge -focus on other public- from Alice’s work. Alice gains recognition of the situation, receives help to manage the conflict and possible good outcomes.

If there is no agreement, the situation is still hashed (with the sign of both parts) for documentation that a repairing approach was taken, but in that moment the conflict had no progress. It could have also a following process, to see if the situation scales/de-scales.

That information Better if could be anonymous for public access and could nurture the decision taking, as marks a precedent for similar situations. What can/cannot be managed, and how.

### Story #2

Miguel was talking about a certain thesis and Martha stood firmly against it. The dialogue starts heating and after some minutes they find themselves pushing away from each other more and more. After the dialogue both of them felt hurt by the other team member, but just Miguel decided to report the issue to the conflict management program. Saying that Martha was being rude to him for no reason. 

The SME should first try to verify the facts and approach the counterparty for lifting the most impartial resume of the conflict. If Miguel’s version was false and his intention was to provoke a sanction to his counterpart, there could be a sanction for him. If it’s proven that Martha and Miguel were both disrespectful to each other, there could be a small sanction for both. In all cases there should be the conflict manager follow up, where both Maria and Miguel Could talk openly about what drove them to that point and try to look for non repetition and healing agreements.

### Story 3: The whales
Reference: 
https://blog.makerdao.com/the-market-collapse-of-march-12-2020-how-it-impacted-makerdao/
https://forum.makerdao.com/t/signal-thread-do-we-compensate-vault-holders-that-were-completely-liquidated/1713

A proposal to refund a liquidation process that occurred inside a protocol was submitted. The proposal didn’t pass because big whales made weight to tilt the voting process. Some leaders of the refund proposal felt that decision wasn’t representative of the organization's values.

Suggested approach: The leaders of the refund proposal ask for accompaniment to conflict management supporters. After verifying facts, a group of the proposal decliners is called for getting their justified point. An impartial version of the facts should be written to ask for both part’s initial recognition of the situation.

There should be help on searching for solutions. And even if the agreement to address the issue is the voluntary retirement of certain members from the project, there should be a following process to offer support for the members that decided to retire, appropriate company could help in searching for new opportunities and dealing with the issue.

Soft skills that could be applied: Learning to differ without making it personal - The Art of Saying No: Save the Deal, Save the Relationship, and Still Say No  
* There should be recognition of the people that represents the declined proposal instead of being pointed out by the protocol’s decision winners. 
* The results have shown no turning back points where each part has it’s own point of view and recent’s the other. How could we help to deal with this situation managing people’s feelings, saving relationships, avoiding moral judgements “Good-bad”.   

### Story 4: The hack

https://medium.com/@ogucluturk/the-dao-hack-explained-unfortunate-take-off-of-smart-contracts-2bd8c8db3562[ag]
https://fullstacks.org/materials/ethereumbook/16_appdx-forks-history.html

A protocol is being attacked, its funds are being drained, and there is conflict around the concept of “immutability”. The conflict scales quickly and a hard fork is made to split the chain. There is no precedent about this. 

Each part has justified points of view. Maybe in that moment the points were too far from each other and there were no managing margin, but if an impartial review of the facts could be signed by the two parts, besides having the record of the issue, and accompaniment of the process to all parts involved, Maybe there could be a next phase of negotiation in a time (let's say 5 years), where the evolution of technology has proven that some of the parts had more reason in that moment. In that case, there would be more negotiation margin and there could be half-way points to benefit both parts.

F/Ex. To deal with problems of “immutability” there has been more consensus to the approach of building layers on top of the main. So the approach to the issue that caused the separation has evolved. There are valuable people in both parts but very few collaboration between them. - Could we help to heal relationships and promote cooperation between forked protocols?

Without this program: the result would be rivalry, hurt feelings between ex-colleagues. The parts keep pushing away from each other.

### Story 5: personal problems 

Maria is an active member of the community, she is normally very collaborative in community calls and working groups, but for some weeks she’s been absent and nobody knows why. 

Any member of the community could report the issue so that an SME in conflict management approaches her in a friendly way for offering interest in her wellbeing and the motives of the change of behavior. This could be a private process that could be useful when people are being affected by something external to the organization, or with issues that people are not comfortable openly communicating. As a community of humans backing up each other, each individual should be relevant for the system.

### Story 6: the hive 

https://forum.1hive.org/t/story-of-a-bee-why-farming-was-delayed/875

There should be awareness of conflicts that may arise that are not listed in the graduate sanction system. And the group of conflict management supporters in the organization should be able to propose management protocols that could include new types of behavior in the graduate sanction protocol. This group of people should be in charge of making the system be antifragile and able to nurture from unpredictable social behavior.

## Divided vs Unified

* [(video) My Stroke Of Insight - Jill Bolte-Taylor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyyjU8fzEYU)

What we're gonna talk about today is based on this first video, my stroke of insight with Joel bolt Taylor. 

One of the aspects that we're gonna talk about today with regard to spiral dynamics and nonviolent communication is just two different ways to think one is unified. The other is divided. What nonviolent communication is intended to do is, and one of the big outcomes from all of my 15 years experience with is that it allows you to create unified thinking from divided thinking within yourself to understand what your own feelings and needs are. 

As a result of understanding that within yourself, to then extend that same compassionate outlook to others, and what's Spiral Dynamics does is it actually gives you an incredibly deep way to prevent the creation of enemy images within a given context.  

One can contextualize all of our behavior and even our personal stories in terms of spiral dynamics, it is an unbelievably deep framework. It's so deep, Ken Wilber has created an entire theory of everything with this as it's fundamental framework. 

## Workshop
We are going to jump into the workshop and the workshop is really easy. I want you to write, and I am not going evaluate this or anything. I, this is an activity that is for you. I want you to write about a conflict that you've had in your life. I want you to write about that conflict as a gift and how in that moment, like you thought that things weren't going to be okay, but then like you learned from it, and that conflict has made you get into this point.
