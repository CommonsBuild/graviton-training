We could even do like a really short exercise, a little short imagination work for reframing some emotion to a more positive or reframing some, just an example. This is something that I picked up from [Richard Bandler's Getting the Life You Want](https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Get-the-Life-You-Want/Richard-Bandler/9780757307768). 

He has all these really cool exercises where you identify a situation and identify the emotion and where it is going within your body and then you identify the opposite situation and find out where that feeling. 

Then, if you want to feel better about a certain thing, then you can move that into the place in your body where you recognize that you're feeling good or motivated. Yeah, that's a good one. Lets do motivation, cuz that's a neutral subject. 

#### NLP Exercise

First we want to think of something that we are super motivated to do. No one could stop us. When it's time to do this thing, you are just full bore. I just want you to imagine, if you have pictures in your head, what does that look like and then where are the pictures? Maybe the pictures aren't in your head, maybe the pictures in your shoulder or what, wherever it happens to be. 

Then what are the senses? Do you hear anything? Do you smell anything? Do you, what do you feel? Where in your body is it in the front of your body back? Is it isolated? Is it just in one particular area? Is it vibrating tingling? Is it moving counterclockwise around your center or is it moving forward front to back, top to bottom thing or back top to bottom? Identify all that. 

Once you have all that in mind and you're anchored in those sensations and those feelings, then you can think about something that you've been procrastinating and you've been putting it off, but you really wanna do it, and you're going to do it, but you've just have been dragging your feet a bit.  

Think about that and think about where that is in your body and how what you're hearing, what you're smelling. Does it taste like something, whatever sensations, what direction is this feeling moving, where is that located? 

Okay, so now you can take that image of the thing that you've been putting off and you can move that into the space where you were super motivated and you can change the direction of the motion to the direction of that you wanna feel. 

If you change it to those other modalities, you should find that you are now associating those positive feelings with the subject you were previously dragging feet on.

You can even do things as simple as once you've identified, you don't even have to contrast them, but just isolate a single anxiety on their own. Once you find the way of feeling is moving, you can in your imagination spin it faster in the direction if you want to feel more that way and spin it in the opposite direction to feel less of that way.  

That's just a little taste for neurolinguistic programming, Rricher Bandler, Get the life you want. Really highly recommend it. It's like just super cool ways that we can use our mind to create our experience and not just be subjected to whatever we wake up with and whatever life throws at us. 

It can be really effective immediately, which is awesome. A lot of this work is long term, but there are some tools such as NLP and also self-hypnosis and different programs that you can find that will suit your particular needs and your particular situation. 

Please do your research and make sure what you're getting into and some of the programs will have, sounds that alternate and if you're just be aware if you're sensitive to different sounds. Just make sure you're working with something that feels good for you and doesn't activating you further. 

Talk to me again in another six months or a year and I'll have a lot more complete answer. That's what I can offer right now as far as all that goes.
