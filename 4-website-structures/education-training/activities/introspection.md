# Session 5: Soft Governance & Culture

## Introspection

I will move a little bit the focus of our work into something that I think is super important, and that is very inaccessible. The, in the, in the crypto space, in the digital space, maybe that is spaces for introspection. I've been reading a lot about how we are in an extroverted society, in a society that praises so much, but out of a balance passing the healthy point, the extrovert states. 

I'm not talking about personalities, but about states of being. Whenever you're super loud or funny, or even aggressive, all of the extroverted qualities you receive attention, and we've been leaving in this economy of the attention that is constantly trying to capture you. We we've been pooled by giving attention to so many different things.  

Many of them are so great. Of course, there's so many amazing things that we all want to be a part of and be on top of. But this comes at a cost of a lot of these questions, not being asked. A lot of this perspectives, not being shift, a lot of our behavior, continuing to follow a way that has been following for so long, because many of the things that are capturing our attention continue to ground this narratives. 

If we are trying to propose different narratives to ourselves and to change the perspectives, the safest place to go is inside and probably the last known place and the one that will help so much with conflict management, with understanding each other. 

Coming from self knowledge, as a portal to know the other, to understand the other, to put yourself in someone else's position, I used to say that acting is an exercise of empathy, because it is using the tools of understanding the other, but in your own body and in your own self.  

A lot of those moments bring great insights because you start to recognize your boundaries that we were speaking about before and understand what is yours and what is not. There's so many times where we feel triggered about something, or we feel uncomfortable about something and they're not even us. 

They're not even ours. Looking with care and curiosity to ourselves helps us to look with care and curiosity to others. I would love to propose an exercise that there is a type of theater that I like a lot that it's called BAU. It's a Japanese type of art. It's a little bit dark. 

If someone knows about it, I came postwar in Japan, but they, they used the body to reconnect with nature. I think, and from a subjective Ima energetic way. I think it makes sense that postwar, they would want to do something like that to express themselves and to look inside and to heal. 

In conflict management, it's a lot about healing as well. I want to propose, well, all your cameras are closed. I hope everyone feels comfortable about it in your own spaces. If you are in a public space and you can't stand up or walk a little bit, or if it's gonna feel weird and you're embarrassed, I dunno, you can do just the visualization of it right where you are.  

### Guided Meditation

I will suggest that we stand. For now, you can look at me, but soon you're gonna close your eyes. Make sure your feet is well planted in the floor. Then you have a straight posture, your, your loose, your, your knee starts slightly bend, stretEch out a little bit, feel, feel your body feel in this comfortable position. You've been sitting for a while. 

Then now you're gonna scan your body. Look at your feet. Look, look at you, look at your feet, your knees, your hips, your chest, your arms, your hands, feel your head. You can massage a little bit, touch your face, and now you can close your eyes and just let the images pass. Don't judge them. Don't try. There's no right or wrong. Don't try. Don't overthink. Just give it a full breath to empty it up. Then I'll guide you.  

Now, the sole of your feet, that it's very grounded in the floor is gonna open up. Like there's two doors in the sole of your feet, one in each, and you open up and everything that is inside your body is gonna fall in the earth. All your blood, all your organs, all your bones, everything is falling, but you're stand. 

Don't worry about it. How does it feel when everything just like your, your body's empty? It's your skin that has an incredible force to hold you. Just like you are. Now. You can close the doors of your feet. Now that you're all empty. Then you're gonna open a door on top of your head.  

It's it's quite a wide door. You open the top of your head, feel the air coming in and this empty body. Now it starts the rain it's raining so much. The rain is touching the inside of your skin and it starts to fill your body up. What is the temperature of the rain? 

How does it feel when each drop touches the inside of your body? How fast are you feeling up? It's raining so much now. There's thunders standards. Can you feel the electricity inside? Is the water calm or is it turbulent? Let the rain feel all your body.  

You're all full of water. Now you can close the top of your head and feel, feel this body full of water. How is it? Does it, does it move? Is it easy to stand up? I hope it is. Cuz we're gonna do a little walk. How, how is it a step with water inside? Do you feel it bouncing in different parts of your body? 

Do you still feel the temperature? How is it to breathe with so much water inside, pay attention in your boundaries, the water fill in all the space inside of you. Can you feel it better?  

Now? You can slowly come back into standing still. If you can, you might be shaking a little bit, give a full breath, still feeling the weight off this water in the ground, and now you're gonna open the doors of your feet and now you're gonna close it. You're empty again. Stay empty for a second. 

When you give a full breath, magically, all your bones, organs, blood muscles will come back into place and you can open your eyes in your time. I'll propose a round of sharing. If you, if you don't want to share, it's okay. You can just pass when it comes to you and this, you, you, this is just like a little bit of a brief exercise that you can make in so many different ways. 

I used to make with snow and with fire and with Leafs. There's all this qualities of something that enters your body and you have to deal with that. That helps to understand the feelings that that touches. Maybe this was very brief, but it's also good to have like a journal practice after doing a body exercise.

(01:02:51)
**Juan Carlos**:    That practice that I do that is on open, open it says that sometimes we load and we charge ourselves with memories that doesn't let energy flow through us. Sometimes we are charged with that old energy that doesn't let like new things come on. It was, for me, it was very meaningful to like for a moment when I opened the door in my feet, feeling myself empty and then letting my myself like be filled by pure water. 

That is something that let energy flow through. Is it, it was like a really good exercise for me to like, to like, let some things go and, and understand some new things. I got a little bit distracted when I started working, but it was a really weird feeling to like feel myself filled with other things that is not the usual that I have in me. 

Is there anyone who wants to volunteer to talk?  

(01:04:29)
**Speaker 6**:    I can go next man. When the water hit my brain, it felt really weird and it was, yeah, that wide open door. It was like a cleansing moment. It felt really good. 

(01:05:00)
**Speaker 8**:    Yeah. It felt really good to have my feet open and have everything fall out. I feel like there was some things that were stuck in there and it just really felt really good. I actually really felt everything coming out of me, blood and bones and organs and brain and everything. Then to have the filling on the inside felt amazing, really cold. 

It was cold water, but it was really refreshing, jumping into a lake and it felt so good to be filled with that. It was really weird walking. Everything was actually slushing around and yeah, I really enjoyed this exercise. I've never done it like this. 

I have seen this in yoga in the forward doing a forward bend where you, you feel sort of the same door on your head, but you're upside down. Things are falling out of it in that case. But yeah, I think this is a great exercise for coming back into the body. I think this is something I needed, even just standing. 

I haven't even just stand up, stand it up for that long in a while. Really appreciate that. I'll, I'll pass it over to ddan.  

(01:06:20)
**Speaker 4**:    Yes. Asked, thank you. I very much needed that. When you said open the doors up on the bottom of my feet, I was just like, whoa. That's like, I mean, I've, I've done a little bit of visualization and trying to work with energy, but opening the doors really, really did it for me. I don't know who hasn't gone.  

(01:06:53)
**Livia**:    So met Verde. You wanted to speak?  

(01:06:57)
**Speaker 2**:    Yeah, it was, for me, it was like just a little bit warm water and no, this was perfect, but, but it, the what, once I was full of the water, I, my organs felt like they wanted, they kept trying to come back in and I was like, no, you're staying out for now. I'm just full of water. You know, then the same thing with like, you know, walking and it feeling like feeling the water moving around inside me, and I don't know who hasn't gone. I just thought it was gonna, my organs wanted to come back. As soon as I was full of water, the organs were like, oh yeah, we wanna come back.  

(01:07:35)    
**Speaker 10**    It was incredible. Li I wa when I was feeling the, when it start to rain, I was feeling cold, but at the same time, it was hitting my skin. Then when I get full, I was like moving like a tornado. It was incredible. I, and actually I think combined these things with the theory, it helps a lot to retain the content. You did an amazing explaining of the content. Thank you so much.  

(01:08:06)
**Speaker 11**    I wanted to thank you. That was really moving as somebody who's, you know, worked on these different quadrants. I think the external experience so often gets forgotten. I was a training and development manager, and I can tell you, especially in human resources, we don't have a lot of self awareness and senses. This was such a powerful exercise. I appreciate you bringing that to the community. Thank you for having me.  

(01:08:39)
**Speaker 5**:    I'll go next. I'll just add a little bit to what you could to grow said around. You know, I think we have this perception that our mental and physical states are disconnected and really they, they support each other. If we're not physically active or present in our physical sense, sometimes our mental capacity dwindle from it or suffers from it. Then through what, why G G said around sort of yoga, you know, there is many years where I did Bero yoga and there'd be these crazy positions you would be in. The, you know, the final conclusion was like being at peace. Doesn't mean you're not in the midst of like really difficult times or hard work or impossible poses to hold. It just means that you're in that. You're still calm in your heart, despite all the chaos and crazy around you or that you might be feeling you can hold on to the calm in your heart. I felt like being present, you know, having those, those doorways to let go of things is kind a trick or a key to staying calm in your heart. I really actually appreciated that exercise. Thank you.  

(01:10:01)
**Speaker 3**:    Thanks, Olivia. That was really cool. I've done all kind of crazy practices. I think this brings to light. One of the challenges of being in virtual community is to still maintain cuz it's so cerebral and heady and we're kind of these weird little floating head avatars. I think maybe sometimes we say things that we wouldn't normally say or it's for me, I find it's harder to kind of like have that presence and like open curiosity, especially when maybe some other tabs are open. Yeah, I think this kind of like embodiment exercises are really powerful to, and so much of what I think we need in your discussion of like quantitative and qualitative is the challenge too, is like the qualitative is the intuition and the embodiment, and it's hard to recognize and like, how do we, you said, like, how do we do this in a virtual community? So this is amazing. Yeah, I think getting in touch with the elements and these visualization practices are great practice to start and our time together. It's just so refreshing. After all this time on the screen and yeah, thank you. You are such an incredible teacher, the way you explain things with your storytelling. It's really beautiful. I've learned a lot. Thank you so much.
