> Foster the practice of nonviolent communication, empathy, understanding and management of conflicts in decentralized communities, to facilitate human coordination and build a culture of trust between peers.

> A civilization that proves incapable of solving the problems it creates is a decadent civilization.  A civilization that chooses to close its eyes to its most crucial problems is a stricken civilization. A civilization that uses its principles for trickery and deceit is a dying civilization. - A. Cesaire (Discourse on colonialism)

Following [E. Ostrom’s Principles](https://www.onthecommons.org/magazine/elinor-ostroms-8-principles-managing-commmons) (specially # 4. Rules are enforced through effective monitoring by monitors who are part of and accountable to the appropriators –, # 5. Violations are punished with graduated sanctions, & # 6. Conflicts and issues are addressed with low-cost and easy-to-access conflict resolution mechanisms). 

### Elements considered as Minimum Viable Parameters (MVP) for a conflict management program inside the TEC:

* Transparent human monitoring: A rotating group of individuals to be accountable for the design and strategic guidance of social agreements.
* The decentralized organization/communities should have defined rotative roles associated with conflict management, with responsibilities, benefits, and requirements.
* Reasonable graduate sanctions: Agreed procedures to address and scale the management of complex disputes (can end on a call for arbitrage to an external organization).
* There should be tiers of social behavior related to graduate sanctions. Something like a “thermometer” that helps to recognize the gravity of the issue and how to deal with it.
* Easy access for conflict management. Talking about a conflict with a Subject Matter Expert (SME) can be helpful to encounter common points after a fraction between parts. This implies the inclusion of possible disputes to be managed within the system. 
* It could be associated with a bot or a typeform, where people send their reports towards a conflictive situation and then with a distribution figure, the case is assigned to a person that should approach the parts involved to manage the issue according to the graduate sanction protocol.

## Ethics behind the rules we promote - [From TEC code of conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S5EoWbsFt3uQ5Wj6yyUJKyApFyjCQ-EloZAr6W55N3U/edit)

* Prosocial - We value designs that create public goods over profit. Profit is not bad, on the contrary, it is critical towards our goal of creating a regenerative economy that supports the Token Engineering community, but providing services to support the TE community is more important than making a profit.
* Human centered - We encourage initiatives that are focused on using token engineering in an ethical manner, and strive to only create positive impact.
* Safety - Everyone should feel safe to be, interact and express their opinions and contributions free from any malicious reaction.  
* Resilience - We ask members of this community to communicate openly and to make an effort to maintain alignment with the TEC vision, mission and values. If conflicts arise, we expect members to act peacefully towards a resolution and the restoration of harmony and efficiency.
* Integrity - Honesty and consistency lead to trust, which is a core value of healthy communities. Our approach is to trust first, and any instances of scam, mislead, spam or defraud will be treated as a violation of this code of conduct. 
* Open source - Ideas are meant to be shared. We default to using GPLv3 and Creative Commons with attribution licensing on our work, but we accept all open source licenses. 
* Non-hierarchical - Everyone is encouraged to exercise their autonomy, creativity and full agency when acting in the Commons. Every individual is wise in their own manner and the diversity of perspectives enriches our Commons. 
* Transparent - We value individual  efforts, honest behavior, & proactively identifying incentives, especially if there are conflicts of interest, when it comes to proposing, funding, work progress and other important activities involving the TE Commons.
* Accountable - Community members are expected to be accountable for all their actions and commitments. Accountability brings trust, and trust is critical for our success. 
* Value Driven -  we encourage members to support the TE field more so than the opportunity for token values to rise

## Applying systems thinking to our culural approach
(01:15:30)
**Durgadas**:    We take systems level thinking and apply it to our cultural approach and to understand that the approach we're gonna take to our cultural thing is going to come from the evolution we have along these, in these quadrants and in this spiral. Right? And so this part is, is really important because if we don't understand how that relationship exists, then we're going to carry whatever unconscious, like, call it from the culture or from our own trauma or from all these things. There are more tools to unpack all that at each level, this is a unifying principle, but you know, if people have questions about this from a personal standpoint, I have other graphics like how does, how does communication happen between two adults, for example, and I'm gonna have another version of this document that talks about what, if you have a mature person talking to a child and and so on. This all can apply from a different context.
