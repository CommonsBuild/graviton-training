 > The Regenaissance is the potential cultural era from 2020 to 2030 where the seeds of planetary regeneration were sown, and the harvest begun.
 > 
 > The Regenaissance is born, like the Renaissance, from an information explosion.
 > 
 > In a few centuries the development of macro and micro-optics transfigurated the medieval cosmos, the rediscovery of ancient Greco-Latin code pried open the Christian hegemony, and the invention of the printing press sparked an explosion of cultural creation.
 > 
 > But the Regenaissance must manifest in a single decade.
 > 
 > We stand before the transportal of AI, gene editing and the Anthropocene. How we yield this triforce over the next decade will determine all life to come.

 > Metamodernism seeks to collapse distances, especially the distance between things that seem to be opposites, to recreate a sense of wholeness that allows us to — in the lay sense — transcend our environment and move forward with the aim of creating positive change in our communities and the world.

 > Sometimes the sort of understanding metamodernism offers us is a logical understanding of how and why things happen during this particular period in human history. In this sense, we can see metamodernism as a  “system of logic” that helps us better navigate the digital age. 
 > 
 > At other times, metamodernism helps us understand our emotional reactions to things that are happening now—both our reaction as individuals, and the reactions of whole communities and even nations—at which point we can see metamodernism as a “structure of feeling.” 
 >
 > In short, cultural philosophies help us make sense of our times by seeing patterns in how entire cultures (and individual subcultures within those cultures) operate. And because American culture, like any culture, has political and economic subcultures as well as ones in which new art is regularly being made, metamodernism gives us a lens through which to consider nearly everything that’s happened in America [and the rest of the world] since the invention of the internet: political, socioeconomic, and sociocultural.

> “There are three different parts of political metamodernism:
> * **The Listening Society** — which is the welfare of the future, a welfare that includes the emotional needs and supports the psychological growth of all citizens. A society in which everyone is seen and heard (rather than manipulated and subjected to surveillance, which are the degenerate siblings of being seen and heard).
> * **Co-Development** — which is a kind of political thinking that works across parties, works to keep ego-issues and emotional investments and biased opinions in check, and seeks to improve the general climate of political discourse: “I develop if you develop. Even if we don’t agree, we come closer to the truth if we create better dialogues and raise the standards for how we treat one another.”
> * **The Nordic Ideology** — this is my name for the political structure that would support the long-term creation of the listening society and make room for co-development. It is called the Nordic ideology because its early sprouts are cropping up in and around Scandinavia. It includes a vision of six new forms of politics, all of which work together to profoundly recreate society. A large part of this has to do with how to defend citizens from new sources of oppression that can emerge as a side-effect of a “deeper” society. These new forms of oppression are generally of a more subtle and more psychological kind than what we have seen in the 20th century.”
