**c) [Using Spiral Dynamics to understand development](https://medium.com/@jthowlett/using-spiral-dynamics-to-understand-development-930098e8f092)**

> [Ken Wilber](https://integrallife.com/), the American writer on transpersonal psychology and his own [integral theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_theory_(Ken_Wilber)), has used and popularised Spiral Dynamics in his work.
> Spiral Dynamics was developed by [Don E. Beck and Cristopher Cowan](https://www.talent.wisc.edu/Home/Portals/0/LMD/Beck%20Cowan-Managing%20Spiral%20Dynamics%20-%20Introduction.pdf), based on the pioneering work of developmental psychologist [Clare W. Graves](https://www.clarewgraves.com/home.html).
> 
> Spiral Dynamics is a model and language which describes the development of people, organisations and society. It helps us understand the value systems (what they care about and what motivates them) of different people and organisations, as they move through distinct stages of development.

**d) [Integral Dynamics, A new integration of Wilber’s Integral Theory and Spiral Dynamics](http://www.ijhssnet.com/journals/Vol_6_No_6_June_2016/10.pdf)**

> Currently we get caught up in deep crises that follow each other faster and faster. In this paper, we develop a coherent analytical framework that may tackle the major problems of our time in a coherent and integrated way. We present a new integration of Wilber’s Integral Theory and Spiral Dynamics that provide more possibilities for analysis: IntegralDynamics. Upon these Integral Dynamics our approach is as follows. Wilber describes four holarchies from the perspectives of the quadrants. We move on to octants and we ascertain that the value systems of Spiral Dynamics, with their typical colours, fit in this extended scheme of Wilber.

  * [Behavior ≠ Intention](https://spirals.blog/articles/behaviour-vs-intention/)
    > Can you remember a time when someone you knew (a friend, a lover, a boss, etc.) was doing something you just didn’t understand? It would go on for what felt like ages until, eventually, you realized why they were doing it. It dawned on you the real reason for their behavior (something they may not have even realized themselves), and your whole perspective shifted?
  * [Wholearchy over Hierarchy](https://spirals.blog/articles/wholearchy/)
    > Our house’s foundation isn’t worth less than the walls. In the same way that the roof is not better than the door. Looking at Perspective as a “wholearchy” puts things under a different light. It places a much-deserved emphasis on founding perspectives like “Purple” and “Red” simultaneously removing the misplaced significance of more complex colors such as Yellow and Turquoise (and for many, Green and Orange). Taking away the “hierarchy” allows us to view all colors equally, to be seen objectively, and treated fairly. It balances our understanding of Perspective.
  * [The Individual & The Collective](https://spirals.blog/articles/i-vs-we/)
    > If you’ve studied Spiral Dynamics for long enough, you may have noticed that a pattern forms between the colors. Beige looks out for itself, and Purple looks out for the tribe/family/friends. Red looks for glory and significance and Blue looks to sacrifice itself for a higher power (organization, nation, religion, etc.). Orange does whatever it can to be the best and look good doing it, only for Green to forget it all and only looks out for the world. And so on…

## Transcript

**JessicaZ**:    Just maybe a question just in looking at this is one thing on a one-on-one personal relationship dynamic, but in a more complex system, or many people here are from that's like shared things being created, maybe value or yes. Things that have this sense. Yeah. Could give an example of a more complex situation or maybe one that would apply within an organization, a project or a DAO I'm sure you're got more coming over the sessions, but for sure. Yeah. Is there anything we can take from this, like it's kinda simple model and applying it to the complex issues.  

(00:28:31)
**Durgadas**:    That is an excellent segue to the very next slide. If you take a look at the way that the spiral works here, the sets of needs, which are had by a person in a given situation is often contextualized by taking a look at the warm colors are essentially represented by this "I" idea. Whereas the cool colors are represented much more by the "we" idea, right? 

Depending on your personal development, what's gonna happen with you is you're going to if you're in achievement mode, competitive mode, like many of us are who work in corporate structures, then when you go to a green community, there are gonna be different kinds of conflictual things that are going to happen and different sets of expectations and needs and feelings that are gonna arise. 

When you're moving from, let's say an orange personal thing into a group which is which is green. I remember when I went from working in Silicon valley a hundred hours a week to living in a commune in a six by six shed with no heater, electricity, my life was very different and I had a lot of different underlying needs that happened, but you could see that every person who put themselves into this communal thing had a bit of a struggle from whatever level that they're on, you know? 

This is actually also, by the way, these I'll just mentiJuanon this in passing so that I get to the next slide. That better explains what you're talking about, and hopefully will speak to the discussions that we had the other day as well around this the story, and might help you to understand what we were talking about. Then spirals a blog is a, is a great website that actually explains many different things. This is the website for the community that has those Wednesdays 5:00 PM spiral discussions. We'll be making the videos. You should read some of these things.  

### (AQAL) All Quadrants, All Levels Spiral

(00:31:04)
**Durgadas**:    Tthe reason why I like this and prefer this particular model to almost anything else is because the placement of the individual work in terms of their internal concerns, which are in the upper left. Then the relationships, norms, boundaries, and customs, which are in the bottom left hand corner. Then the social system that we create on the basis of where all these different groups are. For example, you could say in many ways that the discord is like a part of the organism. 

It's a way that the different people who are organically connected are going to relate to each other. What basically we do is we place ourselves wherever we're coming from in terms of where we find ourselves. I would say that this community in general is a green pluralistic moving.  

A lot of times what'll happen is especially groups will tend to organize themselves on a bit of a chord. That is to say a group of different colors together, which I would say for the tech token engineering community would be the scientific, rational pluralistic, and in integral side of this picture. I could say for example, like the underlying need that everybody has around this token engineering community is to make sure that we have, what, what I'm thinking about here is the onboarding group. 

We can onboard people, but also, sorry, I'm looking down through the, yeah, sorry, the, the credentials aspect of what we have going on. We have the praise system, we have the credential system, and that is a set of visible societal structures and the outcome of those things, which are applied to the individuals in the group that make it so that they would meet the cultural and worldview. 

Everybody has a need for security within the, the situation that we're in here. The, we would make sure that we are dealing with credentials in such a way, and that people get a certain amount of praise and that people are socially acknowledged right. In the pluralistic scientific, rational, integral way that we express ourselves in the community.  

(00:34:35)
**Durgadas**:    so hopefully that's a, that answers your question.  

(00:34:39)
**Speaker 3**:    Maybe, maybe I can just under score score how well this fits really. Also it's not about tech, but actually the whole token space crypto space, right. If you remember, we started with founding teams, and right now everyone is trying to grapple with how to decentralize truly, right. 

We have these people freaking out from scientific, rational. We just need to program and optimize all the thing, tokenize everything. The humanist stuff will just cancel itself out this scientific, rational, and on global scale what could go wrong. Right? And for example, especially with common stack, actually doing the cultural build and really taking care that we become pluralistic. That's, that's what I see now. 

Had brought so many different values, different worldviews. And at first it was a bit of clash for personally, like and actually seeing this biodynamics and just being able to locate yourself and just that's right. Think about it. It's super helpful. Also, I mean, one can even think about how this could be embedded into models, embedded into computer edits, governance, toolkits, et cetera, super helpful.

(00:36:18)
**Durgadas**:    Well, and I will say myself and Tristan, the guy who's running the spirals.blog thing and writing most of the articles, he's also a computer person and is involved. So, and I'm trying to work with M and Fabian too. In this way, and also we're trying to design Sean's company around this. When we're doing all of our strategic stuff, we're all doing it using literally this thing in front of you, so that we can understand where each employee is coming from. The top left side of this picture. 

Part of the challenge that I have for all of you who are in this group is to, if you're going to have conflicts, you need to be able to understand where you're coming from and then understand that the conflict might exist between your putting this eye down into the culture of a group where your, your blue way of thinking, let's say might be clashing with the pluralistic side of the way that we're operating.  

You can also see that some of the growing pains of the community itself might create a internal conflict among the participants by trying to push us from the scientific, rational, the pluralistic. So, by being able to locate where we are individually, and as a group, it provides a lot of ability to not make an enemy image, either out of yourself or the person you might be having a temporary conflict with, or with some of the structural problems that exist within the community. 

For example, many times I feel completely lost in this community. I don't know what the large part of the world view is. As somebody who's in this turquoise, this outside harmonic, holistic self thinking, it's a constant stress for me to not know that because I, it is really natural for me to think about things in terms of the super big picture. 

It is almost a fundamental conflict for me to exist in this structure without really knowing the overall view on the other hand, being in the, in the turquoise way of thinking, it also means that you're like, well, that's okay. I don't really need to know, and I can just accept where I am and that eventually I will figure this out. One of the other really important parts to this that I'll show you on the previous slide.  

### Understanding the spiral

![](https://i.imgur.com/F6lpeK8.png)

Yeah. Well, and you can actually see that some of the ways that we talk about things. If you look at the blue, the blue thing here on the right, the word rules is used a lot in Ostrom's principles, but you can see that that is a very much a blue approach to things, right? 

Part of the thing to understand about this spiral is, and it's super important to get this is that this is not a hierarchy. This is a wholearchy. The idea being that if you're somebody who is in orange, you're somebody who is transcending and including all of the previous colors as well. If you're an orange person, you're really orange, blue purple beige. You know, if you're a green person, you're a green, orange, blue, red purple beige. 

At the same time, the difference between the tier two thinking folks who are in the turquoise and yellow side of the picture versus the people who are in the tier one, thinking the tier one to tier two question is also a source of potential conflict, because the people who are in the tier two thinking are basically integrating or including all of the previous colors, but they are free from them. 

One of the qualities that can produce conflict by participants who are thinking in terms of tier one, is that the tier one thinker at a, at an orange level often thinks that greens are crazy. Blues are nuts, or know reds are just out of their minds and purples, what do they even have? You know, so it's actually a feature of tier one thinking to almost exclude the other colors and even their own previous developmental transcending and including things.  

A person goes into blue by rejecting the red in many ways. People go into orange by rejecting the authoritarian blue. So, and the same thing with, with green green tends to make a big flatland where everyone's the same and no one's better, and there's no hierarchies, there's no nothing. and so I hope that some of that is clear. 

### Connecting Spiral with NVC

It is really deep model and I'm giving you just the, the bare minimum explanation of spiral dynamics. But the reason why I'm connecting spiral dynamics with NVC is because, and by the way, these colors on this don't really match with the previous colors is to the point of all of this is to hearing somebody to be an enemy. Because for example, they're an authoritarian type blue, and you're in orange.  

You can, you can not turn them into an enemy by understanding that there is a part of you which has also got blue going on as well. There is a part of you that has red going on as well, right? And this understanding by itself will tend to push you up toward green because then it makes you a bit more egalitarian in your thinking. 

I'm combining the spiral dynamics and NVC together, because I feel like one of the fundamental outcomes of people who really invest themselves in non-violent communication, both within themselves and then to others, is that is the not creating enemy images from, from people. In many ways, I would say that just since I got here by M and many others Jessica Griffin and everyone, I'm not a token engineer, I've done a lot of things in tech, but I've not a software developer.  

I barely know anything about cryptocurrency. I'm literally three months into my, my, my tenure of knowing anything about cryptocurrency at all. Yet, somehow you guys have managed to find a way to allow me to be included in this group and to help with the cultural build as well. More than that seemed very grateful and gracious about what I do bring to the table. 

It feels to me like it is almost an unspoken thing among the participants in any given DAO, I would imagine, but this group in particular, in my observation, that we're seeking to include other people, almost in a radical unified way, people into the community. I'm attempting to do is to give you a framework that would further that unspoken thing, and to make it explicit, trainable, and blocked out in sections and things that you can go into and learn and understand.  

All of the subsequent graviton trainings in many ways will be contextualized with these larger worldviews. That's why we're presenting it here at the beginning with the expectation that we will continue deepening our understanding of this.

Now this, this evolutionary diagram is quite beautiful. When you think about it in terms of inside, outside in individual and collective, additionally, you can see that conflict could occur. 

If you just take a look at somebody who's thinking of an individual and the context in which they're operating as a collective one may just be a conflict there just because their underlying need is different than the underlying need that the collective is putting on them. 

Similarly, you may have a conflict between the thing which is happening inside of you, which is the left hand side, and the things that that you're seeing outside of you. It is actually the tension between the and the left and the right that creates one's own evolution along the colors that you see here. 

This is actually brilliant that Juan found this evolutionary thing, and you can see how it moves toward the outside as you evolve along these, these different paths.
