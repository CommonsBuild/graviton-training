### Question 9: Can DAO offer similar benefits as traditional corporations?

(06:09)    
**Bianca**:    The question that we prepared for you is many people in DAOs work without most of the benefits that traditional corporations can offer. **Can DAOs offer similar benefits?** What's your vision for future of work in Web Three?  

#### JAKE 

**Jake**:    A big thing for us is we don't just wanna stop at what is the required benefits for each jurisdiction. We wanna offer way more than that. The sky is the limit when it comes to benefits. We're even talking to companies such as [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app), they offer a meditation app, which is on the mental health side of things. 

**_It's really about offering, not just what is expected, but more than that._** Because we think to attract the best talent and keep the best talent in this space, we need to really go the extra mile and offer more than what people might be used to or might be expecting.

### Question 10: How does the future of work look?

(08:06)    
**Incandenza**:    How does the future look like? Like they say, DAO are the way work will, will be organized in the 21st century. **What can we expect from the future of work?**

#### JAKE

**Jake**:    People can, it's a lot of this is collaborative. We're not necessarily here to say this is what it should be.. We're very open to hearing what people want as well. The main thing, what you'll see in the future is more personalized benefits for contributors. More specific to the jurisdiction they're in as well. 

We are partnering with benefits brokers in different jurisdictions so that we can offer not only what they tell us is required, but more than that *we speak to benefit brokers so that we can get the best of the benefits for people and not just what is compliant*. 

The future, a lot of it is unknown, but I said, we are looking at new benefits that aren't necessarily commonplace in Web two companies and traditional working places and also benefits that can be adapted to Web Three. 

Not everybody is, it's not like your traditional companies where everyone's in the same place and you can go out and do like work team things together or whatever. It's very much needs to be adapted for the Web Three.   

### Introducing Bill (Opolis)

**Bill**:    I'm finally in like 15 minutes. Twitter spaces doesn't work with the desktop Twitter. You have to use it on your phone.  

(10:43)    
**Incandenza**:    Oh God. If I knew that. Yes, of course. Bill, would you like to introduce yourself who you are, what you do and why you do it? Yeah. The way you do it.  
   
**Bill**:    Of course. I'm bill, I've been in the DAO space since 2018, first building DAO platforms. Building technologies to allow people to form DAOs more easily and then joined [Opolis](https://opolis.co/) about a year ago. 

We provide payroll compliance benefits and the ability to get paid and pay yourself in crypto for freelancers and Web Three contributors. We're worked out their customer is the DAO or the crypto company. Our customer tends to be the individuals that work for one or many DAOs or work for many clients in the crypto Web Three space. 

The mission and the goal is pretty shared, **it's all about getting people, especially in this Web Three space access to high quality benefits**, access to payroll compliance, make their life easier, make it comfortable to work in Web Three for folks so that they can have the benefits and experience of working for a big company while actually working for some internet native organization or a cutting edge startup.  

That's what we do. I'm on the product side. Like Jake thinking about what better benefits can we get folks, what can we do to improve the experience of being like a crypto native freelancer? What integrations can we offer so that the freelancers that join Opus really have like a commercial command center at their fingertips and can manage their work life from a single place.  

### Introducing Patrick (WorkDAO)

(13:35)    
**Incandenza**:    Less alert, Patrick. I would like to introduce yourself as well.  

#### PATRICK

**Patrick**:    I'm the head of growth for part of the biz dev team at [WorkDAO](https://www.theworkdao.com/about). Jake pretty much summed it up well for what we're doing in the space, very good as well in terms of our synergies and how we're really approaching the market. 

Just a couple things that we do on our side since we do have a couple models, is we do offer since we act as employers for on behalf of these pure DAOs that I know we'll get into later for these contributors that want some real world benefits the whole world isn't DAOed yet. 

There is still certain obligations that need to be helped. I know bill mentioned this, but visa sponsorship is a huge one having the necessary paperwork for even things like mortgage loans. Depending on where you are, if you want to even start renting apartment. 

On the payroll side, we do also figure out RTUs and RTA investing contracts, which is pretty exciting for us.  

### Question 11: What's the difference between a "Pure DAO" and Limited Liability DAO

(15:00)   
**Incandenza**:    Thanks, Patrick. Let's start digging deep in what you do. First question, I would like to ask to Jake for WorkDAO. In your [WhitePaper](https://www.theworkdao.com/whitepaper), as a Patrick introduced before, you make a distinction between pure DAO and [limited liability DAO](https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2022/09/17/a-primer-on-daos/) from contributors point of view. What's the difference? Could you explain that to our audience?  

**Jake**:    Yeah, I actually think Patrick would be better tackling this particular question.  

#### PATRICK

**Patrick**:    Yeah, from the contributors perspective, Bill can definitely also chime in here as well since he's on the legal side of it, but you're looking at pure DAOs that have zero legal entity, they have no legal wrapper around them at all. With the liability wrapped DAOs they're actually legally recognized entities depending on where they form it. 

From a contributor's perspective, if you're gonna be a contractor, not for benefits, but for payroll a lot of European countries have VAT tax that needs to be invoiced. Who do you invoice that to? You're gonna have to invoice that to a legal entity and pure DAO don't have that.  

You have to assess how much risk you're willing to take as a contributor getting paid from that DAO and how much risk the DAO is willing to take when they're paying out contributors or when something goes wrong in their treasury, or if they did a token swap and something goes wrong, how much risk are they willing to take? 

Those are the huge distinctions that you have to look at from the contributors perspective when you engage with pure DAO versus those that have liability rappers. That's why one of the biggest things that we do for the contributors, for Opolis, is actually actually wrap the individual. 

That way they have that piece of mind with engaging with different DAOs cuz let's face it. A lot of DAOs sometimes could be anonymous. [Wonderland](https://wonderland.money/) could be is a very good example to where there's some stuff that went down there and people didn't know cuz the CFO was anonymous. 

They found out that his past history could really affect the individual contributors. If we were able to act as that legal entity for that DAO, then both contributors and the DAO, both sides are safe, you know? Those are the ways we look at it from both contributor perspective and the DAO perspective.  

### Question 12: You hire people on behalf of a DAO, who are legally working through you, and can use that legal protection to work for other DAOs?

(18:22)    
**Incandenza**:    As you said before, **what you do is basically you hire the contributors on behalf of the DAO, and then contributors can work for different DAOs through you?**

#### PATRICK

**Patrick**:    Yes. That's so the one distinction there is that is also gonna come down to the DAO that we are working with. We might be employing them on paper and acting as the employer, but we have no say over the contributors, if the DAO lets you be autonomous and lets you work in different projects while you're being employed by them, then all the more power go ahead. In terms of us being that factor or giving that say, it's not up to us that's up to DAO.  

#### BILL

**Bill**:    Yeah, I can follow onto what Patrick said. He's right. That there's like a big difference in risk profile between DAO with a legal entity for legal wrapper and DAO without. That's where we've tried to mitigate that risk by saying, wrap yourself as a contributor in an LLCs sCorp, this is US specific. 

> This model works in the USA and Canada, but essentially wrap yourself in an LLC SCorp, professionalize yourself, and then invoice the DAO just as you would invoice any client you would have as a freelancer. 
 
That means you can invoice one DAO. If you just do all of your work for one DAO, you can also easily invoice multiple DAOs because you are employed by the business that you own, in our case, rather than the DAO or your clients.  

Our model really allows DAO to be ethereal and internet native and not have to worry as much about incorporation or legal entities by pushing the legal entity to the contributor level. 

Not to say that's right for all DAOs, I'm not given legal advice, but just our philosophy has been, let DAOs be DAOs, but so that you can like connect the DAO world to the meat space, professionalize yourself, wrap yourself in an entity, bill the DAOs like you would bill any other client with like do proper tax withholding. 

Do all of that because at the end of the day tax authorities, probably aren't going to try and bother going after like amorphous internet organizations that are global. They care about whether they get paid by the individuals who live in their countries and that's where we're focused on those individual contributors. 

Giving them the liability protection as well as the tax compliance and benefits that they need to work for whoever they want without necessarily worrying about the entity status of the DAO or the organization or whatnot.  

Unfortunately, I have to drop for a developer stand up. It was nice to be on here with some of the WorkDAO folks that are doing some really cool stuff alongside what we're doing in the space.  

**Incandenza**:    Thanks for being here.  

**Bill**:    No worries. Now we knows. Gotta be mobile.  

### Question 13: How will decentralized employment organizations compete?

(23:45)    
**Incandenza**:    Yeah. I was curious to ask, I dunno if Patrick could answer, because I was really fascinated by the concept of decentralized employment organization and how this new entities will compete. I know this is more a Opolis thing, but if you also know something about it. 

#### PATRICK

(24:12)    
**Patrick**:    I can share from what I know for Opolis, their whole ideology is more of a cooperative based approach, since a lot of the DAO legal structure is still up in the air and see which countries are gonna actually allow them to be LLCs. 

With all the anonymity that goes on in the space, they're looking at it as why don't we just wrap the individual. That way they're covered. They're only liable for the contributions that they've made to the DAO, but since their legal wrapped themselves, and then create a collective where a bunch of people can all come in and then pull together.  

That way they're able to get group rate benefits on a larger scale for cheaper premiums. For the healthcare side. That's a little different approach to us, but I do see merit in that especially if DAO contributors want to stay semi-anonymous and want to be able to stay freelance versus being sent being tied to just one or two DAOs, they want to have that lifestyle. It's more of a lifestyle approach in my opinion. 

(25:50)    
**Incandenza**:    Thank you, Patrick. Super interesting. Would like to leave the stage to Bianca, if you wanna ask the following question.  

### Question 14: As a DAO contributor with no benefits, if I join Opolis or WorkDAO, how does that work?

(25:59)    
**Bianca**:    I contribute to a DAO where I have no benefits nor protection. If I join Opolis or the work DAO, how does the process work?  

#### PATRICK 

**Patrick**:    If you join, Opolis, you'd have to be in the US or Canada. That's the pretty simple answer. I hope Bill's proud of that answer, but for us, we want to contract on the DAO basis. Our approach, a good example for me, for instance, I contributed to six different DAOs at one point. 

However, I still had a full-time job because I live in the states. Then when I lived in Korea there are certain things that I still need to provide in order to make my life easier. It just didn't make sense for me to ever leave my Web2 job for Web3, when in Web two, I'm already getting all the benefits and I don't have to pay for it myself. 

In WorkDAO specifically, we're looking at more of the DAO should be the ones with their massive treasuries, be able to provide this type of service to their core team members in order for them to be incentivized to stay and participate longer. 

We're seeing some studies done that can, that have direct correlation between contributor engagement versus non statutory benefits that these larger DAOs are starting to provide for their core team members. 

If in terms of the onboarding side, we can use any DAO we could use Bitcoin, for example, once they decide that this is something that they wanna provide as a DAO. They want do a governance proposal and they want keep it open ended for people who might not need it, who want to look at it. 

Once we contract on the DAO level or a sub DAO level through a governance proposal, then we'll do a town hall and basically do a Q and a session similar to what we're doing now with all the contributors and then go through their specific jurisdiction because every jurisdiction, whether it's Columbia, Spain, Germany, or France, are all gonna have different requirements that they need to have. 

Then on top of that, what the DAO wants to provide to their employ and to their contributors, if they don't want to contribute any additional to the benefits side, then it' gonna work the same thing as Opolis. Then the contributor like yourself will still have access to the benefits and still be protected. The contributions would come out of your pocket only.  

### Question 15: How do all the different jurisdictions impact this labor market?

(29:26)    
**Bianca**:    Wow. That was, yeah. Thank you for answering that. That also makes me think about you said there are so many different countries and different tax regimens, different public welfare systems in Web two. How does this background diversity affect a hyper connected labor market?  

#### PATRICK

**Patrick**:    It does get a little tricky, especially with a lot of different statutory requirements that these countries face. It's a good thing. I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing since like the whole point of this space and after COVID hit having the world more interconnected and having such a cross collaboration in labor markets. 

It benefits in my opinion, cuz it just helps us as a whole. I don't wanna get too philosophical, but it helps people understand what the differences are, whether it's cultural or whether it's different macroeconomic standards in terms of each country and how they go about it really helps understand where people are coming from.  

They're there for a reason. Like in the UK there are mandatory pension and national insurance contributions that you have to make versus India has employment training that's mandatory for employers, which is different than other countries. 

The only downside is DAOs might look at it, I don't know if I want to really hire devs in France or countries that have a lot of statutory requirements. Since we have such a huge opportunity for inclusivity in this space, we should be going above and beyond the base minimum requirements to begin with.  

We wanna be better than Web two. When we get the next wave, we want to encourage as many people to adopt as possible, in order to do that, we need to be able to offer not just a base requirements, but way more. 

Even Web two, they hire internationally. They've been doing that for the last 10 years, and it's been normal and they've been offering more than what the statutory requirements are. I don't know if it's that big of a deal, in my opinion, since we should be doing more than the minimum.  

### Question 16: How receptive are DAOs to improving work conditions for their contributors?

(32:47)    
**Incandenza**:    Yeah, totally agree on that should be like Web Three. It's all about building a better environment for everybody. Do DAO understand that what's the benefit that they can have offering better condition to their contributors? Are they receptive on what you're offering? Like what are the reactions normally  

#### PATRICK

**Patrick**:    The reactions. If you take a look at the demographic in this space. The people that are building, it's such a huge opportunity for a new market of new people. In the US, for example, if you're under 26, you don't need to get your own health insurance you're under your family. 

The whole thing that older generation different generations have been saying is, oh, when you're young, you don't need healthcare. It doesn't matter. You're not gonna go to the doctor. You like the only thing you have to worry about, what if I get in an accident? 

That's like one in like a million chance. It's, don't even worry about that. That's the mindset that people can have and that's normal, whatever space you're in my thing is that once they actually figure out because benefits has always been something that's people have been asking for. 

It's just without enough funding to be able to offer that, that's been the question. Once we actually present this to these different DAOs, the feedback or the response is always okay like if the DAO is going to be able to offer this to incentivize me to do a little more work or little extra, more bounties, or contribute a little more, then why not?  

DAO are looking at this as a competitive advantage. Like cross collaboration, DAO to DAO collaboration is great, but as this space grows, we gotta be looking at scalability. The DAOs that want to scale and want to get their communities larger and want their product, want their products to be more diversified. They need talent. 

The biggest issue actually people that have in this space is actually trying to find talent, find devs that have solidity & rust experience. Keeping the current core teams there at some point is gonna have to go beyond passion and into something that entices people to contribute more benefits is just gonna be that extra thing. That's how I see it.  

### Question 17: How does WorkDAO work for projects having smaller treasuries?

(36:10)    
**Incandenza**:    Thanks. Definitely a competitive advantage is a big point in attracting like the big talent. Jake, a question for you does WorkDAO help with DAOs having smaller treasuries to offer benefits to their contributors as well, or your target is just like big DAO?

#### JAKE

**Jake**:    Our target is any DAO particularly, but obviously bigger DAOs tend to have, shall we say, more "permanent" & full-time contributors than newer, smaller DAOs. Just through the nature of that especially early on more of our clients will probably be larger DAOs with lots of contributors that are, they know they're going to be contributing for a extended period of time.

#### PATRICK

**Patrick**:    To add on Jake's point, we're seeing a huge movement in the smaller DAOs because the the larger DAOs already doing this. We're starting to see a shift towards smaller DAO that have smaller treasuries to look at this as an opportunity to start competing and be able to provide this to their contributors as well.  

**Incandenza**:    Thanks Juan. I know you would like to ask a question.  

### Question 18: Many people in Web3 stay off the grid and have much skepticism towards how DAOs are being tied to nation state systems?

(38:06)    
**Juank**:    Sure. I wanted to ask on the end user of a contributor, for example, I know that there's a lot of people that stay off the grid and there's a lot skepticism to how the nation state systems are adopting Web Three within their jurisdictions. 

How do you deal with that paradox of the fear of Web Three contributor getting inside of the loop of the nation state system or how do you protect their anonymity and data from potential constraints of participation from the policy of a nation state system.  

#### PATRICK

**Patrick**:    I can answer that. To begin, what is your biggest concern on that end? What is the real concern here when trying to basically interact with these nation states?  

**Juank**:    Well, maybe harder policies being then try to be put in place towards the people who work in Web Three projects, or also maybe losing anonymity. That's something that sometimes people also appreciate in the decentralized world.

**Patrick**:    I love my anonymity too, when I was contributing as well. It felt great, but I feel like that's this becomes a little more of a point of view on the world. If we want DAOs to scale and want more mass adoption, then like how are we able to do that without ever crossing paths with the law, with the real world? 

Unfortunately the real world still run by a set of rules that are just not gonna go away. They might change. The biggest fear is even for myself, is, what changes will be made here? We're already looking at the scrutiny that they're putting, tornado cash is a huge example.  

Also they're starting to look at stable coins then what's next DeFi is next and NFTs are next. When are the next in these states Wyoming has been much more lenient in countries like Estonia, Switzerland, Singapore, they have been much more lenient on DAO structures. 

That's still up in the air on what we see in terms of what the legal structure is gonna look like and what they're going to be scrutinizing, but for now Opolis and us we have to play nice with them, you know? As long as we just make sure there is no real world consequences, then after that, then we can be flexible. 

Before then there is only a certain point where we can do that. I understand the anonymity portion of it, but when comes to healthcare you're gonna have to use a health insurance provider. In terms of a broker, if you look at the other perspective, they're not gonna wanna insure someone they have no information over.

Then it just becomes the option of whether you want to just pay everything out of pocket or just be able to provide the bare minimum amount of information.  

#### JAKE

**Jake**:    Yeah, just on that as well, just adding to that. If you're a contributor in a DAO, you want to keep your online anonymous, then you can do that. It's just you that we need to know about if we're offering benefits to people. It's not necessarily your online profile that we need to know to provide them benefits. You don't necessarily have to tie the two together. You can still have a online anonymity and get benefits and extra things. Right?  

### Conclusion: What's next, where can people learn more about you?

(43:47)    
**Juank**:    Well, that was an amazing answer. We are getting to the top of the hour of this space and I really liked how it's wrapped up because that was one of the most also common questions that people can make. Yeah, I would like to thank you for coming to this space and also that we are sorry for the small technical inconveniences that we had at the start also, thanks to the audience, but I want to wrap also giving you the space to let us know what's next on your radar and how can people learn more from you and interact with you and your projects. 

#### JAKE

**Jake**:    If you wanna learn more about us, you can head our websites, TheWorkDAO.com and our white papers on there. It's got a bunch of in-depth information. We also have a **discord** server. You can find a link for either on our website or on our **Twitter**, but next steps you guys will see us announcing clients announcing we're always going to events like we were just at a couple of members of our team are at Berlin at the moment. Did I miss anything there Patrick?

#### PATRICK

**Patrick**:    On the product side, things on our roadmap is we're, we're starting to partner with education, learn to earn platforms, to be able to provide education reimbursement for developers, for non-technical sorts, to be able to get bootcamp training. If it's a dev for Web two that wants to join Web Three or get contribute to DAO, but doesn't know code for solidity arrest, we're starting to partner with those type of providers. That way DAO can offer that to their contributors, part of their onboarding process. We're also already doing one-on-one check-ins and mental health check-ins for these individual contributors on a weekly basis. We are ramping up more providers and partnerships for that project. Yeah, appreciate the invite. Appreciate the space you guys helped today is very insightful.
