### WORKSHOP

1. Introduction to the session.
2. Group splits into two for 30 minutes, with Nate and Anna-Marie facilitating a group each. We’ll ask each group to think about an organisation that they’re a part of and then workshop the following:

The first group explores how to create spirals into and out of positions of greater responsibility.We’ll give them the following ideas as a starting point: rituals of honouring and appreciation, time-bound roles (six months, or one year), advisor roles (or an advisor circle) that people can step into, supported hiatus (or offboarding) periods and clear processes on how to do that, knowledge sharing tools that pass over key information to those that step into new roles so those leaving know they can safely pass their role on, etc.

The second group explores how to design and embed ecosystem systems and structures that offer various pathways for inclusion, participation, and autonomy.We’ll give them the following ideas as a starting point: Groups of various sizes, clear internal information pathways, time-bound roles, maximum group sizes, setting up pods or crews (small groups of not more than 7 that meet regularly with a particular focus), facilitated spaces for difficult community conversations about power, hierarchies, social capital, gender, and inclusion, spaces in calls for reflection and contemplation, etc.

1. We’ll come back together so the two groups can share their discoveries and there’s some time for questions at the end.

## Transcription

(00:00:02)    
**Anna Marie**:    This is from a book called he by Brian J. Robertson. It's highly recommended if you don't know it.

Sometimes the conflicts we have in organizational life are actually clashes of the roles involved, but we mistake them for clashes between the people filling these roles. Such conflicts become unnecessarily personal. 

When we try to resolve them by smoothing over the human relationships, we missed the opportunity to clarify the underlying organizational role relationships. A term I use to mean the relationship between our roles and what those roles need, separate from our personal connection. 

I believe that can be actually apply to many aspects of organizational design. That sometimes it's not just about the human interaction, but clashes and conflict. Give us an opportunity to have a look at the systems and structures to see where they can be changed. With that, I'll pass it over to you, Nate, introduce your session.  

(00:01:50)    
**Nate**:    Okay. Thank you. My name is Nate.

### Organizational Design and Creating Pathways for All

(00:04:22)    
**Nate**:    Today's session is titled organizational design and creating pathways for all. As Anna Marie mentioned today is going to be an interactive experience about exploring how to incorporate all the unique elements of decentralized organizations, such as diversity, cultural practices, social and organizational structures, and various individual needs and how they relate to organizational conflict. 

One of the goals that the gravity working group has regarding the development of this curriculum is to provide gravitons with some practical knowledge around mitigating conflicts, within decentralized organizations, comparatively with centralized organizations, we have a good understanding of how conflicts occur, how they are resolved into an extent how to prevent them from happening in the first place. 

We must learn the same things for DAOs. In order to do that, we must first recognize some of the differences we have compared to traditional organizations. Big part of today's lesson is about making sure that gravitons know what to look out for and how to map conflicts back to the correct source. They can probably be documented and shared with one another.  

### Agenda

01. Exploring Individual Motivation
02. Understanding Organizational Design
03. Exploring DAO Dynamics
04. Break out into groups for discussion.

(00:05:30)    
**Nate**:    A quick outline of what we're gonna talk about, the goal of the presentations provided you some basic concepts around organizational structure, individual motivation, and exploring DAO dynamics. Just to give you some ideas to think about where conflict originates, organizational conflict can arise in so many different situational context. It's important to be educated on some of the basic principles. 

Keep in mind, especially if you already understand some of these concepts that I'm about to go over, that they exist as frameworks for how you think about conflict in the environment, in which it emerges. 

The first thing we're gonna talk about is individual motivation and how it takes shape and decentralized organizations. 

The second thing we'll talk about is organizational structure and we'll review some of the more difficult doubt dynamics that we are trying to solve for. 

After that, we'll break into discussion groups and perform an exercise, which we'll share at the end. 

### Individual motivation

![](https://i.imgur.com/06mtp5O.png)

Motivation is an important organizational concern as it is significant factor in determining why people participate in an organization, motivation influences whether individuals strive to accomplish either personal or organizational goals or both as well as to the extent to which they allow others to direct and control their behaviors. 

Many of Maslow's hierarchy of needs chart, where at the bottom of the pyramid, we have our physiological needs, which all of us hopefully have food, water, and shelter. Next is our safety and security needs. 

From an organizational perspective, these needs could be satisfied through things like work agreements, performance feedback, and communicating expectations above that. We have our social and affiliate needs. Things like love, belonging, and intimacy. 

These can be achieved in organizations through social events, shared experiences and community interactions that are not related to work. Then we have esteem and recognition needs, which have to do with the desire to gain status recognition and power. 

From an organizational perspective, this could come in the form of a raise promotion or authority over new work. Then finally at the top of that pyramid, we have self-actualization where the individual needs match the individual's personal desires. 

The reason I'm explaining this to you right now is because by recognizing and appreciating the complexity of human motivation, it allows us to identify some of the areas where DAOs differ from traditional organizations and where they are the same DAOs cannot offer promotions or grant superior power over organizational functions in the same sense that traditional organizations can and traditional organizations cannot offer the inclusivity and autonomy over that DAOs can provide.  

(00:08:23)    

#### Herzbergs Two-Factor Theory

**Survey**
> “Think of a time when you felt exceptionally good or exceptionally bad about your job, either your present job or any other job you have had.  This can be either the “long-range” or “short-range” kind of situations, as I have just described it. Tell me what happened.”
> - Job Dissatisfaction = working conditions, interpersonal relations, supervision, and rules.
> - Job Satisfaction = growth, advancement, responsibility, the work itself, recognition, and achievement. 

The important thing to notice is that these differences are structural in context, a man by the name of Frederick Hertzberg iterated on Maslow's hierarchy of needs through a survey where he asked 200 employees to think of a time when they felt exceptionally good or exceptionally bad about their job and explain what happened. Many studies had been conducted, after that, which have reinforces findings. 

What he found was that bad feelings were consistently associated with the jobs context, things such as working conditions, interpersonal relations, supervision, and rules. These factors led to job dissatisfaction, good feelings, stem from a job's content rather than its context. Things like growth, advancement recognition and achievement. These factors led to job satisfaction. 

The thing that Herzberg recognizes that job dissatisfaction and the factors that caused it, things like rules, supervision, and working conditions are different than rather than opposite of those factors causing job satisfaction. What he recognized was that the satisfaction and dissatisfaction are actually separate concepts and not opposite ends of the same continuum. 

Satisfaction is associated to me's higher order of needs, where we have our self-actualization our basic, self-actualization and in informal things that motivate us.  

(00:09:52)    
**Nate**:    Let's see where we at not opposite the same continuum, higher order needs while dissatisfaction is associated with Maslow's lower order of needs. Satisfy, satisfying, the lower levels can reduce dissatisfaction, but they will never lead to satisfaction. Things like work agreements and feedback and expectations, they can reduce the amount of dissatisfaction an individual may have when entering an organization, but they'll never lead to satisfaction. Only these higher order needs can accomplish that. What does this mean for DAOs? Well, dissatisfaction stems from environmental and structural elements while satisfaction stems from social and cultural elements. 

### Organizational Structures 
> Differentiation vs. Integration\
> Differentiation - refers to the degree of specialization, both vertical and horizontal, in the organization.\
> Integration - the process that includes all the mechanisms and procedures by which the differentiated tasks are coordinated and ordered to achieve the organization purpose.

Important to take into consideration that your approach towards organizational design holds the possibility to create a context or an environment that can lead to job dissatisfaction and potentially organizational conflict.  

(00:10:58)    
We need to recognize that as a possibility, we want to make sure that the safety and security is something that is provided by the systems we design so that they do not lead to this individual dissatisfaction. On top of that, we want to ensure that our social layer is able to provide for those upper order needs. That satisfaction can't be achieved. 

**There are two really important theoretical concepts that gravitons should understand about organizational structure**. 

Those two concepts serve as a framework for organizational design. **Differentiation in integration**, differentiation refers to the degree of specialization within the organization and essence, this is how we organize the different tasks of the organization, which aligns with its stated purpose. Differentiation takes the form of working groups who are specialized to achieve specific organizational goals.  

### Structural Components and Organizational Conflict

* **Legal and Formal Constraints** - more constraints on procedures, spheres of operations equates to less autonomy for individuals making decisions.
* **Reliance on Appropriations** - more reliance on resource systems results in more incentives for cost reduction measures.
* **Complexity and Objectives** - lead to greater tendency of conflicting goals.
* **Incentives & Incentive Structures** - greater difficulty in devising incentives for effective and efficient performance.
* **Personal characteristics of employees** - Variations in personality traits and needs, such as higher dominance and flexibility, higher need for achievement.

Your DAO may look something completely different who knows, but they're organized based on organizational function. The more differentiation differentiated the organization is the more complex it structure becomes integration. On the other hand, refers to the mechanisms and procedures that allow for differentiated tasks to be coordinated into purposeful action. 

We have differentiation how we organize ourselves and integration, which allows us to coordinate that organization into purposeful action depending on how we organize ourselves and how we coordinate between those groups has significant implications on determining the environment we all operate in. 

Some different structural components that are determined through these foundational design concepts can lead to organizational conflict. The degree of exposure to resource allocation, legal and informal constraints, more constraints on procedures and spheres of operation creates less autonomy for individuals. 

The complexity of objectives, evaluation decision criteria can lead to greater tendency of goals to be conflicting within an organization. There, these foundational theories have impact on the incentives and the incentive structures that we create, the personal characteristics of employees, variations and personality traits and needs require flexibility and higher need for achievement. 

If your organizational design cannot accommodate for these needs for higher achievement, you may run into significant aspects of conflict. 

### Common DAO Dynamics to take into consideration:
- Horizontal Communication
- Agency & Discretion
- Information Sharing
- Rewards System
- Individual Advancement
- Formal Hierarchy vs. Social Hierarchy
- Political Influences

What is it about DAOs that set them apart from our traditional organizations, exploring DAO dynamics is something that we are currently doing on a daily basis. A list of some common structural elements within DAOs that have the potential for conflict are a lot. 

Let's see the structural components of organizational design have significant include some organizational conflict. What is important to note here is that most organizational conflict is derived from the integration procedures I spoke of a moment ago. 

In particular, communication, due to a DAOs flat organizational structure, they rely almost entirely on the method of horizontal communication. Horizontal communication serves important purposes for the organization, such as task coordination, problem solving, information sharing. 

Of course, conflict resolution. This type of communication is likely to be informal rather than formal oral, rather than written and unofficial rather than official.  

Since authority is absent from horizontal communication can often lead to moments of miscommunication where coordination among peers can take forms, which are irrelevant or destructive to organizational functions. An associated problem in do dynamics is the problem of agency and discretion where there's no clear authoritative power structure. 

Making simple decisions becomes problematic within DAOs agency. Overwork is difficult for many people because we have been accustomed to think and act in hierarchical systems where the benefits include a clear chain of command and task distribution information sharing is another problem area within DAO dynamics where miscommunications around doing can lead to a duplication of efforts and increased tension among peers. 

Next, we have a reward system stratification of reward systems, meaning different roles get paid differently. It can be a common source of conflict. Individual advancement is a really difficult and downs due to lack of hierarchical power. Certain forms of advancement such as creating spirals into and out of greater roles of responsibility can be really important.  

I find it really interesting that the things that we look at as weaknesses within DAOs can also be a source of organizational stability in times of change and conflict and how we design our DAOs can have significant influence on how we create the cultural practices, as well as the social underpinnings that allow us to make decisions within decentralized context. 

We want to try to utilize these two aspects, the individual motivation, understanding a hierarchy of needs, and then understanding how organizational design influences those needs within the user experience of any individual entering a DAO honorary. I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that in terms of what we're trying to educate on and for these workout groups.  

### Break Out Groups

(00:17:18)    
**Anna Marie**:    Let's jump into the practical. What I'm gonna do is share in the chat two different scenarios, and we're gonna break into breakout rooms in groups around four to five, and you're gonna have about 20 minutes as a group to explore these two scenarios.  

As you look at the scenarios, the suggestion is to imagine a situation that perhaps you already experience in a DAO or any organization or an experience that you've had in a previous organization and using the wisdom that we all have, that we gather from our time in communities and organizations to just explore there's no right or wrong answers here. 

It's just about what, from our own experiences, what can we bring to these two examples? The first one that I'm sharing here is about creating spirals into and out of positions of greater responsibility.

#### The first scenario is about creating spirals into and out of positions of greater responsibility

Some examples that might help your thinking is something along the lines of could use rituals of honoring and appreciation. 

Might you want to bring in timebound roles? Could you consider having advisor roles that people can step into? Could you have supported hiatus or off boarding periods for members and clear processes for how someone can do that? 

Would you perhaps implement knowledge sharing tools that make sure that information is passed over from members stepping out of a position of greater responsibility? Those are just some examples. 

#### The second scenario

It's really up to you as a group to choose which one you think is of greatest interest. 

This is creating various pathways for inclusion, participation and autonomy. Here, some examples that might help you is the idea of having groups of various sizes, having clear internal information pathways, time bound roles, having maximum group sizes, setting up what some people call pods or crews, which are small groups of not more than seven that might meet up regularly and form intimate bonds, facilitated spaces for a difficult conversation, such as power hierarchy, social capital, gender, and inclusion. 

Lastly, what about spaces for, in the calls for reflection and contemplation? As we put you into the rooms, say the chat will stay up. You get to choose as a group, which one you'd like to dive into, I'd ask that someone is chosen or office to volunteer as a note taker to jot down what are some of the ideas that you come up with. When we come back together, we'll share them with each other.  

### Questions Comments

(00:21:26)    
**Anna Marie**:   Just wanna open this up and invite anyone that'd like to share a bit about the ideas, maybe telling us what you focused on, what some of the ideas were for the group, but also to share, how was the experience for you? Was there any place that felt stuck or uncomfortable as you were discussing and exploring all of these things? If you just unmute yourself and share, if you would like to tell us a bit about how that was for you.

(00:22:28)    
**Speaker 7**:    Well, I'll go only be only because the first thing that the, your second question I can address immediately, which is that I was just like entering it, quite confused and a little anxious about not really understanding the assignment. Oh, I'm still not still, not entirely sure that we're getting what we're, that we necessarily came up with, what you were looking for per se, but we did at least talk, share some stories about potential areas for conflict in both DAO spaces and outside of in food space. Okay. Spaces.  

(00:23:02)    
**Anna Marie**:    Do you wanna share what you found confusing about, was it the particular instructions or the idea of exploring those different aspects?  

(00:23:13)    
**Speaker 7**:    I think, it's mostly because I just wanna I wanna do it right. Or whatever. So that's the energy that I come at a thing with. I was not able to receive the updates that you sent in the middle. I was, like, oh shit, are we doing something wrong? We're just talking about our stories and not discussing the examples that you gave.

(00:23:34)    
**Anna Marie**:    Well, no, that's fine. You went on your own way. Sure. Was there anything in the shared stories that really struck you as a group?  

(00:23:47)    
**Speaker 7**:    One thing we talked a fair bit about just like our experiences in different organizations and how opportunities for conflict can arise. I was asked to share my particular story only because it was a preventative measure, I suppose. There's a bike shop in Tacoma, Washington, where I live that is in food space. 

Of course you can't fix bikes online. The at the beginning of COVID, they, after they made the decision to remain open through the pandemic and start to figure out how they were going to implement that. 

One of the processes that they implemented was like just a two hour session at the beginning of every day, be like their first two hours of being open. 

They were not open to the public. They were only open to staff as an opportunity for the staff to just like express the things that were coming up for them, from dealing with all of the public and also express some of the things that they needed from each other. 

In terms of support and areas where there was developing conflict or whatever, just like opportunities to off gas, some of that, and allow them to keep providing this essential service even during a very difficult external situation.  

(00:25:06)    
**Speaker 8**:    Okay. Cool. Great. Thanks for sharing.  

(00:25:16)    
**Anna Marie**:    Someone from one of the other groups that'd like to share a bit about what came up for you?  

(00:25:21)    
**Speaker 4**:    I just shared some of the notes that we took in group number one, and we were discussing about how to create these spirals into and out of positions of greater responsibility. Okay. We gave really good ideas. I don't know if Tammy or Lynn went to deep dive on some of them, but we talked like a certain rituals to welcome people in groups, but also other things like when someone is no longer participating in the community, that doesn't makes them an enemy or that they are ghosts. Even if people is no longer in the community, we can still be friends and they can still hang around, have, and their role and their recognition as a human being. Yeah, we, I don't know if lean or time want to share more of what we said.  

(00:26:28)    
**Speaker 9**:    Sure. You covered it pretty well. We were really talking a lot about our experiences and the organizations that we're in. Carlos and myself that took an engineering commons lean with extinction rebellion. Which she shared some really interesting ideas around how there is a role called locomotive roles in their circles. These roles have an incentive to be rotating so that things don't get stagnant in terms of the circles. I thought that was something very interesting and new interest, insightful perspective. Then we talked a bit about like having agency to make decisions, which is perhaps one of the facets of having responsibility is making decisions for the community and how those, how important that is. Then this concept of advice, process, and having agency to make decisions. The responsibility of getting advice from the people impacted by the decisions mm. Before you make a decision, but it not being a blocker to the person who has the agency to make the decision, making the decision, but having consulted people who will be impacted and then the idea of rituals as well. Maybe that came from the rituals of honoring and appreciation, is also important too. We shared some of those that we've experienced. Would you like to add anything else or forest or Umberto or Nick, 

(00:28:13)    
**Anna Marie0**:    You did an amazing job. It was good. Thank you.  

(00:28:18)    
**Anna Marie**:    Well they sound extraordinary. You're absolutely right. It's very easy to treat someone that's perhaps removing their time and their energy from a community is a there's something painful about that. Therefore the relationship changes. That's really spot on to notice that and that doesn't have to be that way. I also think that's a fascinating idea about having roles that are incentivized to keep them rolling over so that you are constantly getting people moving in and out of that responsibility. Fascinating. I love that so much. Will you share those specific ideas in there? Graviton channel for us all as well? Brilliant. We've got a couple more minutes. It'd be lovely to hear from maybe one of the other groups.  

(00:29:07)    
**Anna Marie1**:    I can talk if you'd, can I share my screen? Cause this is a thing that I shared in the group and I've shared it in gravity before, but basically we were talking about the potential that problems could arise at any level of this. This is basically a graphic that I made that shows what I've come to think of as like the cellular process for people to interact. So if you're coming out of a centralized organization, the curation, which is the fix stuff we've done the way we've always done, it can often be this conflict because people don't wanna break out of that. I find that in DAOs this gravity style interaction where you have somebody who's moderating and they're holding space for what's been done and holding space for the yes.  

(00:30:05)    
**Anna Marie1**:    And part of the connective cross pollination emotional portion of that. That's why I call them the educational change agent because the technical change agent is generally done. As a after we've done all this other work, we end up here and we can also start here, but we should go through this process of, and I often find that each one of these three sections, people can get bogged down. People could get bogged down and I didn't know enough to consent to something they can get bogged down into maybe somebody didn't ask 'em what was alive in them. They didn't engage for example, or they didn't go through a process of sense making so they could grasp the whole context of everything. There's a, there's in the original, in the original ask, it was very much talking about the second thing, which is how is it that we create these pathways? And just recognizing that there is a rough structure to how things go in the DAO space that might be different than in other spaces. That's why I made this graphic, cuz I was wanting to document how that functions so great. I hope it was helpful.  

(00:31:21)    
**Anna Marie**:    Brilliant. I love that. Is there anyone else from that group that wants to share, perhaps we've got just a couple more minutes about, were there any examples of specific things you think that could be, that could be specific structures or anything in a DAO that could be useful to help as you navigate those potential discomforts?  

(00:31:54)    
**speaker2**:    If I can say something, I was very interested in one point that was made about when you're asking questions, because you're trying to direction find it's that process about asking for consent. Right. So I thought that was a very interesting comment that we discussed in part, but maybe not as deeply as we could have.  

(00:32:16)    
**Anna Marie**:    Right. Okay. What that your discovery was, or you, I feeling was that if you're feeling uncomfortable, if you ask for consent act, that gives agreement on all sides what's and that  

(00:32:29)    
**speaker2**:    And sometimes asking for consent, isn't viewed positively either.
