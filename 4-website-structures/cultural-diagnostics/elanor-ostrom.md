## Three Influential Models

### Tragedy of the Commons
  > “What is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it” 
  > 
  > “Wealth that is free for all is valued by no one, because he who is foolhardy enough to wait for its proper time of use will only find that it has been taken by another” 

1. we are so far from the decision making that it becomes abstract
2. I have no access or understanding to the provision of the resources, therefore I identify with its scarcity 


I'm gonna start talking about the three influential models that Ostrom presents to us for who is not familiar. This is Governing the Commons from Elinor Ostrom. She won the noble prize in 2009 for economics, for giving alternatives to this three influential models. 

So much of our political and economical and social political systems were built on top of this models. They talk in different ways about a very similar problem. That is the free rider problem. The first maybe many of you have heard of already it's a buzzword in the crypto space. That is the Tragedy of the Commons. But what is the tragedy of the commons?  

(00:06:01)
This is actually a very old thought. Aristotle had already stated that what is commons to the greatest number has the least care styled upon it. Basically whenever value is to all that, we don't value this. 

This has so many cultural implications we can start to think about. Why do I only value something that is exclusive? Why do I only value something that is privileged? Why do we have this separation in the way we empower each other? 

This is very much the construction of the power structures we have and who has more power, has more capacity of excluding others from something they have. That's exactly what we're trying to do with the commons that is to not exclude others and still have beneficial outEcome from this shared resources. 

Another thing that stated about the tragedy of the comments is that wealth that is free for all is valued by no one, because he who is foolhardy enough to wait for its proper time of use will find that it has been taking by another. 

This is a concept that Ostrom works a lot and she calls it mind discount rates. So, so you can have low discount rates and high discount rates, high discount rates. They mean that you are only looking for the short term benefit of whatever you're doing. When you have low discount rates, is that you're, you're looking for the long term. 

We've been trying to create systems where people culturally care long term about the wealth that is free and shared. Can wealth be free? Why is this so untangible in our minds? Why is this concept so crazy to understand, because we have been so conditioned to think that wealth is only something that is excludable. 

Why we don't care also about what is free? Why do we want to take it so quickly? Because maybe it won't be enough for us? In my opinion, we are so far from decision making of most of the things in our life, or at least the idea of decision making is very far away that it becomes abstract. 

If I can't make decisions about the water that I receive, I probably don't care so much about the provision of the water. Like if it's provided to me and I'm receiving it, I don't know what are the decisions that are around it. But I know that someone far away is taking care of this. 

This makes so many of the decisions abstract far away from me. Detached from this and detached from the understanding of how those resources come into being, I identify with their scarcity or with their, how do I say with their unrealistic abundance? 

Both of this are, are not so good and would lead to a tragedy of the comments, because if I understand all the work necessary to grab the water and put in the field that it's gonna make my food grow, I would care so much more about how much water I use.  

I would see where the water is coming from. I would see how much there is available. What is the effort with what is the effort attached to it? One thing we've been very careful to implement in the TEC is that everyone feels very close to the decisions to the issues that they would have to make decisions on. 

We are in this process of understanding the rules and the boundaries, but we are doing this together because we are all gonna use from this resource. There are already so many resources that we are sharing collectively. 

Having this understanding of what are all the decisions I'm taking in the every day and decisions don't mean only like voting or deliberately saying yes or no to something. Decisions can also be more subtle and common conversations. You made a decision to come to this call today.  

How many decisions do you make in a day when you pick between eating an apple and a banana that are in front of you? You pick one of them because of some reason that, of course not all of these reasons, you're gonna think about them, but some of them that are very influential on our steps, it's really important to bring them to our awareness. 

Therefore, you understand more, what is governing you. By understanding the decisions I take, I understand also what are the decisions I can't make and why, and how far I am from them? Is there any, any questions on the tragedy of the comments or any thoughts on this? or I can pass to the, to the next one.

### Prisoner's Dilemma 

> “In a prisoner's dilemma game, each player has a dominant strategy in the sense that the player is always better off choosing this strategy, no matter what the other player chooses.”
> 
> “The paradox that individually rational strategies lead to collectively irrational outcomes seems to challenge a fundamental faith that rational human beings can achieve rational results.” 

1. Cooperating beyond rational choices - ratio, quantitative 
2. adding qualitative variable
3. rationality often excludes very important variables of the human behavior. Big problem of the theory and its practical implementation 

Okay. The second dilemma she talks about is the prisoners' dilemma. It's kind of a variant of the tragedy of the commons, by the same author. In the prisoner's dilemma, each player has a dominant strategy in the sense that the player is always better off choosing this strategy, no matter what the other player chooses. 

The example she gives a lot is of farmers, and they have a certain number of cows that they can put in that field, but the field can only feed as many cows. 

If they put a lot of cows and there's not enough food, the cows will die and they will not get the profit from what they would of like the milk or the meat, or what, how are they or relating with the cow. 

It's knowing that they have a limited resource that is the food for the cows, that they would both want, that they would both want to maybe put three cows each and then they would, they would both get the full benefit of those cows.  

The cows would be super well fed, but in a prisoner's dilemma, it's they call it a non-cooperative game. There are many variants that are most around communication, that communication wasn't inserted in this game as a super important piece. 

Maybe they won't communicate. If they communicate, they don't have the understanding that they need to provide rules for how they're gonna share that space. Maybe they're too far away. The cows go like further than their communication. 

It ends up that one of them thinks, oh, if I put six cows here, all of my cows will eat very well, but then the other guy's cows won't have any of that food. But then if the other guy also thinks I'm just gonna put six cows here and my cows will eat very well. 

What happens from both of them choosing the dominant strategy for each one of them is that the outEcome for both is less optimal than if they had collaborated. But for some reason, they still don't choose to collaborate. 

This is the paradox that so many scholars go crazy about. There's like 200,000 essays about the prisoners' dilemma.  

Academics cannot understand why individually rational strategies lead to collective irrational outEcomes, those challenges of fundamental faith that rational human beings can achieve rational results. 

It talks a lot when I was reading this, it talks a lot about rationality and the tragedy of the comments too. The logic of collective action too. Those words started to be like annoying. Why does the human being is immediately attached to rationality? 

It's almost like what defers us from any other animal is that we are rational. But when I look up rational, the ophthalmology of the word comes from ratio that is quantitative measure. We are talking about human beings that are complex systems on itself in a rational quantitative way, and expecting the best outEcome. 

When we only look to this variable and the state has only been looking to this variable and the firms have only been looking to this variable. Then it becomes like, oh my go this far on, on this, on this.  

How does it look to cooperate beyond rational choices? What are other variables that are in place and how can we start adding qualitative variables to human interactions? 

There's so much of our interactions that are towards quality over quantity, and even in their relationship of this two guys and their farms, there are so much that wasn't considered of their relationship of their backgrounds, of their family situation. 

Many variables that could be more qualitative, that if we had that information, maybe creating another type of game where it would be optimal for both of them in an easy way, could be the best choice. 

Rationality often excludes very important variables of the human behavior. This is a huge problem of theoretical work when it comes to practical implementation. 

This is a lot what governing the commons is about, is a lot of empirical, on the ground experiments to bring more insights than the limited theoretical material that we had so far to look into this. 

### The Logic of Collective Action 

> “One who cannot be excluded from obtaining the benefits of a collective good once the good is produced has little incentive to contribute voluntarily to the provision of that good” 
> 
> “Olson considers it an open question whether intermediate-size groups will or will not voluntarily provide collective benefits. His definition of it depends not on the number of actors involved but on how noticeable each persons actions are.” 

1. The free rider problem 
2. the subjective value of a hitchhiker 
3. transparency not only to monitor, but to be seen.

> “One who cannot be excluded from obtaining the benefits of a collective good once the good is produced has little incentive to contribute voluntarily to the provision of that good” 
> 
> “Olson considers it an open question whether intermediate-size groups will or will not voluntarily provide collective benefits. His definition of it depends not on the number of actors involved but on how noticeable each persons actions are.” 

The Logic of collective action, that is the third one is talking mostly about the free rider problem. It says one who cannot be excluded from obtaining the benefits of a collective good. Once the good is produced, has little incentive to contribute voluntarily to the provision of that good.  

(00:19:48)

It's that kind of thing of like when you were in school and the teacher would say, oh, go in groups of five people. Then there was always the people, or maybe you were this person that will look for the nerds of the class and will say, "I'll go with them because then I don't have to do anything" because they will do all for me. 

Because it's a group, everyone is getting the grades and there's always, this is such a classic dilemma, even with kids. This makes me question even how systems have been built and how schools have been built and how grade systems have been built for this behavior to start coming up so early. 

Also there is the guy that talks about the logic of collective action. He considers it an open question, whether intermediate size groups will or will not voluntarily provide collective benefits. He's definition of it depends not on the number of actors involved, but on how noticeable each person's action are. 

If everyone in that group in the class was being seen, would they have the same behavior, or if they could give contributions and other ways that is not the way that they find boring or that they're not excited about, would that change the dynamic of that group? 

What things they could create if other things were considered in this, in this way of looking at collaboration. I'm thinking also the free rider problem made me think of being a hitEchhiker. I hitEchhiked so much in my life and that's like the literal being a free rider kind of example, you're on the road, you're getting in the car that you're not paying for that trip.  

When you're meeting someone new, the biggest thing for me was I always felt like I needed to give something to the person that was giving me a ride. This in this exchange is way more subjective than the value of like paying for a share ride or is just another value. 

What are the subjectivities of pre writers that we are failing to see? And I think this could be a reflection for many of the communities that we see this happening. Much of what is, what is the value that we are failing on integrating? What are the multiple value flows that are happening in here? 

I am focusing just on one and through this one avenue, everything around will fall and will collapse. Those are just questions to bring it up for us to reflect that our kind of, kind of open and connecting with the work that we've been doing in the TEC. 

Another thing I thought was that transparency is not only to monitor and we'll get there to talk about transparency as a monitoring practice, but it is also to be seen. 

What if we start shifting the perspective of "rules are so bad" or "monitoring is so bad" to "how can we create a place where people really feel seen?" And because everything is transparent because everything is open. 

Therefore they want to collaborate. They feel they belong. They want to participate. 

## Eleanor Ostrom's 8 Principles for Governing the Commons 

1. **Clearly defined boundaries** - Individuals or households who have rights to withdraw resource units from the CPR must be dearly defined, as must the boundaries of the CPR itself.
2. **Congruence between appropriation and provision rules and local conditions** - Appropriation rules restricting time, place, technology, and/or quantity of resource units are related to local conditions and to provision rules requiring labor, material, and/or money.
3. **Collective-choice arrangements** - Most individuals affected by the operational rules can participate in modifying the operational rules.
4. **Monitoring** - Monitors, who actively audit CPR conditions and appropriator behavior, are accountable to the appropriators or are the appropriators themselves.
5. **Graduated sanctions** - Appropriators who violate operational rules are likely to be assessed graduated sanctions (depending on the seriousness and context of the offense) by other appropriators, by officials accountable to these appropriators, or by both.
6. **Conflict-resolution mechanisms** - Appropriators and their officials have rapid access to low·cost local arenas to resolve conflicts among appropriators or between appropriators and officials.
7. **Minimal recognition of rights to organize** - The rights of appropriators to devise their own institutions arc not challenged by external governmental authorities.
8. **Nested enterprises** - Appropriation. provision. monitoring, enforcement. conflict resolution, and governance activities are organized In multiple layers of nested enterprises.

#### 1. Clearly Defined Boundaries

The first principle is clearly defined boundaries and I think boundaries is something so important since the very personal level to bigger systems and to the macro level. When you think about boundary of yourself, what are the boundaries of your body? 

They might be your skin or your hair. There is a little bit more out or the sound of your voice or how wide are the movements you can make. There, there are so many layers to boundaries, right? There's also the emotional boundaries, the subjective and the objective boundaries. 

If we can find all of those for our bodies, imagine for a system. In the system that we are at now that we are building, that is the TEC, this is, this is very curious. It's like, what are the boundaries of this, of this organism it's, it's alive. 

It keeps moving in very dynamic directions that we have to be very attentive, paying so much attention to understand these movements and compute them in a way that will inform everyone that is joining. Just like you find healthy for yourself, and you say, no, here, this is my space I I'm until here. 

Then you can go here or you can come closer. Or so this identification of boundaries in a complex system is also very dynamic. It's been taking a lot of inputs from a lot of people involved, mostly all of the working groups that we've been understanding, one said, like, what are the actions that are required? What is allowed? What is forbidden? What is it for the TEC that is too much?  

What is that crosses the boundary of the TEC? So this is for all of us to be aware of. If there is any, any insights of those to communicate and to continue with this process of updating the boundaries that we have. So, and, and one last thing is that it's a lot easier for physical communities to find those boundaries and to find the boundaries of their resource systems. 

For us, it's a little bit more challenging. Even, even the mediums we've been using, even the discord has its boundaries. Like there's a limit of people that can join here. There is a limit of actions you can take in this platforms and so on. 

#### 2. Congruence between appropriation and provision

The second principle is congruence between appropriation and provision. This is often translated just as rules, but I think it has a nice depth into seeing into congruence between appropriation and provision.  

That is this balance to keep it regenerative. What is coming in and what I'm utilizing and how this flow is happening? Am I appropriating more than the provision that is coming? Am I providing so much, and there's not enough movement for appropriation?

This optimal balance is, is what we really want is what we want to bring to the TE community, especially how can we advance token engineering by providing so much for them to appropriate for us to appropriate. For that, a certain rules are needed. 

You can also call these rules, boundaries, but it is a certain shape of what can come in and how this resources are used for this continued flow to happen. 

#### 3. Collective Choice Agreements
The third principle is collective choice agreements. This requires to decision making, being available to everyone for these arrangements to be done by the people who will be affected by the arrangements they are making. So everyone has a say on whatever will affect the people that have a say and vice versa. 

#### 4. monitoring. 

> “When the rules in use conform to the design principles discussed in chapter 3 (enabling individuals to design rules that will keep monitoring costs low) and individuals adopt contingent strategies, individuals are also motivated to monitor each other to obtain the information they need to pursue this contingent strategy.” 
> 
> “If individuals begin monitoring others and learn that others comply most of the time with a set of rules, they are more likely to be willing to adopt and/or continue contingent strategies.” 

I will jump into this light to talk about monitoring is really interesting the way she, she puts it, that when the rules and use conform to the design principles discussed in chapter three. That is people make their own agreements and individuals adopt contingent strategies, contingent strategies are those arrangements. 

Individuals are also motivated to monitor each other, to obtain the information they need to pursue this contingent strategy. She says that people have an incentive to want to monitor each other, to look what everything is happening, because they will obtain information. Information is so valuable. I need to plug my computer. Sorry, one second.  

(00:37:42)
**Juan Carlos**:    An important thing of monitoring is that monitors can be app the appropriators themselves that is very costly to have external monitors to monitor the provision and the appropriation of a CPR. That if, if way more way less costly to have monitoring done between the appreciators themselves.  

(00:38:17)
**Livia**:    Yeah. Thanks Juan. Then the second point she brings is that if individuals being begin monitoring others and learn that others comply most of the time with a set of rules, they are more likely to be willing to adopt and or continue the rules, the contingent strategies. This is a concept. 

She talks a lot about that. I like the how bold it is. She talks a lot about the suckers or the people that take the, how does she call it? The, yeah, there is, or, or you comply and everyone is complying, or then no one is complying just you. Then you become a sucker. 

It's this idea of that. If others do, I'll also do. She says that by, by incentivizing monitoring, mutual monitoring, everyone monitoring each other, that you can learn that others are complying. You feel more comfortable to comply as well. 

Because the rules were provided by the very people that are using them and monitoring them, you can change them as well. If there is a rule that it's always being broken and there it, it doesn't work anymore. There is an incentive to look collectively into that rule, but because everyone is mutually monitoring, they will have this information. This information is valuable data about the system that they all want to cultivate, because it will be a collective benefit for them.  

#### 5. Forgiving Rules \ Graduated Sanctions

(00:40:16)
**Livia**:    And then graduated sanctions. That is one of the roots of gravity and the importance of this graviton training and of all the work Huka is doing because with graduated sanctions, she also has something very beautiful about it. 

> “If individuals make honest mistakes or face personal problems that occasionally prevent them from following a rule do not have access to mechanisms that will allow them to make up for their lack of performance in an acceptable way, rules may come to be viewed as unfair, and conformance rates may decline.”
> 
> “The way in which rules are enforced is forgiving of occasional lapses and errors and allows appropriators to avoid the high costs that can result from rigid application of uniform rules in a changing and uncertain environment”

With graduated sanctions, you can have forgiving rules, you can see the provision that individuals made for this institution, for each other. You can see them as chances to forgive. 

She mentions that in two separate parts of the book, that if individuals make honest mistakes or face personal problems that occasionally prevent them from following a rule, do not have to access, do not have access to mechanisms that will allow them to make up for their lack of performance in an acceptable way. 

Rules may come to be viewed as unfair and conformance rates may decline. I think it's very beautiful. There's this view of like, they want to make up, let them make up, let's have this rules, this graduated sanctions that don't the same sanction for something very small as for something very, very big.  

Then the other thing is the way in which rules are enforced is for giving of occasional lapses and errors and allows appropriate or to avoid the high costs that can result from rigid application of uniform rules in a changing and uncertain environment. 

This is also very important to consider this as a variable, even the word forgiving and making up brings such a human perspective to thinking of rules that already makes it feel like, oh, we all want to organize each other. 

We know that to organize ourselves and be autonomous in this system, we need some type of processes, boundaries, rules, mechanisms. Let's use this in our benefit and see this in our benefit. 

#### 6. Conflict Resolution Mechanisms

It's very natural that we have a reactive rebel nature against them. But, but when we're talking about rules that are made by the people, for the people, for something that will be a collective benefit for all, it changes this, how we see ourselves inside of this inside of the system and then six conflict resolution mechanisms. 

This is again, it's the whole purpose of gravity to provide accessible conflict management practices. One once corrected me and corrected Ostrom that it's not conflict resolution, but it's conflict management because you might not resolve a conflict, but you have all the tools to manage it in the best way. 

I see so many communities and I'm sure all of you as well, and maybe that's why you're here seeing so many conflicts, breaking communities apart and making like very amazing projects fail because we've been like denying this huge variable off a variable of being a human that are like so complex. 

#### 7. Recognition of the Right to Organize
We are, as we are way more complex than the systems that we are calling complex. Then number seven minimal recognition of rights to organize. This is talking more in relation to external authorities. If we are providing our own rules, then where are we in inserted in? Do we have to comply to someone? What is this? 

So a lot of common pool resources, they fail because people were organizing themselves and then they are going against the state rules. Then there is a problem in this relationship. How do we assure that we are like, okay, in this sense, and for this, we have the legal working group that we're looking into strategies for being, having minimal recognition of rights. 

That's why we decided to use the commons tax risk association, because we are provided with that somehow to have a legal shield as a protection. 

#### 8. Nested Enterprise
Then number eight is nested enterprises. This doesn't talk so much about nested that the TEC as a whole is nested among other DAOs from the bigger ecosystem. 

It can also refer to that, but it's mostly about how all of the principles are like its own enterprise nested within each other. There are layers for them to happen. It's not one single source of management that will be responsible for everything. 

I'm really confident we are doing that as well to be, to have this multiple points of organization of management, hence all of the working groups and leading with those as separate things that are nested within each other.  

## Notes
**c) [Ostrom, Governing the Commons](https://wtf.tw/ref/ostrom_1990.pdf)**

> In this pioneering book Elinor Ostrom tackles one of the most enduring and contentious questions of positive political economy, whether and how the exploration of common-pool resources can be organized in a way that avoids both excessive consumption and administrative cost. 
>
> These cases, where a resource is held in common by many individuals - that is, well­ defined individual property rights over the resource are absent - are often held by economists to be exploitable only where the problem of over­ consumption is solved by privatization or enforcement imposed by outside force. 
> 
> Ostrom, by contrast, argues forcefully that other solutions exist, and that stable institutions of self-government can be created if certain prob­lems of supply, credibility, and monitoring are solved. She provides a close study of a uniquely broad range of cases, including high mountain mead­ ows in Japan and Switzerland, water projects in the Philippines and Cali­fornia, and fisheries in Canada and Turkey. Some of these cases involve stable institutions; in other cases the institutions were fragile and failed. 
> 
> Basing her conclusions on comparisons of sources of success and failure in self-government, **Ostrom describes some fundamental characteristics of successful common-pool management schemes**, and concludes with a chal­lenge to other social scientists to build on her original theoretical work.

> This paper outlines the “tragedy of the commons,” reviews Nobel Prize Winner Elinor Ostrom’s principles for sustainable governance of common-pool resources (CPR), and relates both to outer space. Ostrom’s principles were distilled from decades of studies on dozens of CPR situations. They capture the best practices of CPRs that have been used sustainably for decades or even centuries, thus avoiding the famous “tragedy of the commons” without relying on privatization or a “Leviathan” authority. When viewed in the context of space sustainability and governance, these principles highlight some long-standing challenges and emerging issues. Over the past few years, achieving the long-term sustainability of space activities has become a central goal for many, both at the national and international level.
> 
> However, while more policymakers and stakeholders are recognizing the importance of space sustainability, none have spelled out an effective governance strategy, and accompanying policies, for accomplishing it. This paper concludes that Ostrom’s principles can potentially inform those ongoing policy initiatives and highlight specific areas on which to focus initial space sustainability efforts.

### Deontic principles for rules 

> “Institutional rules are prescriptive statements that forbid, require, or permit some action or outcome (E. Ostrom 1986a). One of the three deontic operators - forbid, require, permit - must be contained in a statement for it to be considered a rule.” P.139

### Institutional Change

> “Both origins and changes in institutions can be analyzed using the same theory when both are viewed as alterations of at least one status quo rule.” P.140


### Ostrom’s institutional change framework

### Questions:

1. What is the importance of having a strong cultural build in DAOs?
2. What are the similarities between CPRs and DAOs?
3. What are some of the principles for enduring CPR institutions, according to E. Ostrom?
