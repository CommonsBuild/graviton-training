The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better. *This property is behind everything that has changed with time: evolution, culture, ideas, revolutions, political systems, technological innovation, cultural and economic success, corporate survival, good recipes, the rise of cities, cultures, legal systems, equatorial forests, bacterial resistance ... even our own existence as a species on this planet.* And antifragility determines the boundary between what is living and organic (or complex), say, the human body, and what is inert, say, a physical object like the stapler on your desk.”

> The antifragile loves randomness and uncertainty, which also means—crucially—a love of errors, a certain class of errors. Antifragility has a singular property of allowing us to deal with the unknown, to do things without understanding them—and do them well. Let me be more aggressive: we are largely better at doing than we are at thinking, thanks to antifragility. I’d rather be dumb and antifragile than extremely smart and fragile, any time.
> 
> It is easy to see things around us that like a measure of stressors and volatility: economic systems, your body, your nutrition (diabetes and many similar modern ailments seem to be associated with a lack of randomness in feeding and the absence of the stressor of occasional starvation), your psyche. There are even financial contracts that are antifragile: they are explicitly designed to benefit from market volatility.
> 
> Antifragility makes us understand fragility better. Just as we cannot improve health without reducing disease, or increase wealth without first decreasing losses, antifragility and fragility are degrees on a spectrum.

> There are things that don't like volatility, and things like volatility, and it's a very, very extremely bipolar view of the world. You almost have nothing in between.
> 
> Effectively, all I did is generalize this idea, to map it to things that option traders-- because option traders, all they do is they drink and they trade options, so they don't have exposure outside of that narrow field. So all I'm doing is representing them to take the idea outside.
> 
> And we can do a lot of things, because effectively, fragility is something I can measure and anti-fragility is something I can measure.
> 
>But risk, you can't really measure--unless, of course, you're at Harvard or Stanford or one of these places where they have the illusion where they can measure risk. But in reality, we can't measure risk. It's something in the future. I can measure fragility.\

> The graph you have here shows you very simply a fragile payoff where nothing happens most of the time. When something happens, it's negative. You see? This is a fragile, and everything fragile has this property.
> 
> To give you a hint, we can generalize it to medicine where you take pills that give you very small benefits. The benefits are small or nonexistent, and the harm is large and rare and often not seen in the past history of the product. That's a fragile.
> 
> I take a pill, it gives me small benefits, and then 10 years later, you realize that it gave you cancer or some hidden disease that nobody saw. It's the same payoff for fragile.\
>![](https://i.imgur.com/TRMK4AA.png)
> The robust will have this payoff--it doesn't care--and the anti-fragile will have this payoff where harm is small and the big variations are positive, are favorable.
So this is sort of like the idea or the general idea.

# Nicolas Taleb - Antifragility

The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better. **This property is behind everything that has changed with time: evolution, culture, ideas, revolutions, political systems, technological innovation, cultural and economic success, corporate survival, good recipes, the rise of cities, cultures, legal systems, equatorial forests, bacterial resistance ... even our own existence as a species on this planet.** And antifragility determines the boundary between what is living and organic (or complex), say, the human body, and what is inert, say, a physical object like the stapler on your desk.”

The property of antifragility is behind everything that has changed with time, evolution, culture, ideas, revolutions, political systems, technological innovation, cultural, and economic success, corporate survival, good recipes, the rise of cities, cultures, legal systems, equatorial, forest, bacteria, resistance, even our own systems of species on this planet. 

**What is antifragility?** Anti fragility is the capacity to learn from things is the capacity and its different. It's different from resilience and robustness because when things are resilient, they receive a shock and then they can receive it again, and then they can receive it again so that they become so strong that they can have this shock so many times, but they don't change.  

They just like are strong enough to receive the, the wanted behavior so many times, but they don't change. But the difference with anti fragility is that instead of being able to receive the same shock for so many times, we learn from that shop and then we are able to avoid it or to take another decision or to not step into that same stone. 

The difference between resilience and anti fragility and robustness is that robustness can receive shocks, tt doesn't change. Resilience is the same that like, it can receive a lot of shocks and stay the same, but antifragility, antifragile is things that when they receive a shock and then they improve, or can avoid having the same shock.  

That property of antifragility is something that we all have as humans. That we also all should try to put in practice in our everyday life. The best way to verify that you are alive is by checking, if you like variations, food would not have taste. 

If it weren't for hunger, results are meaningless. Without effort, joy cannot exist without sadness. Conviction cannot exist without uncertainty. We should embrace the difference and see it as a gift and something that can help us to improve and to become more anti RA, rather than seeing difference as something that can destroy us. 

Because if we see conflict as something that can destroy us, we are being fragile. We are being fragile, or, and we are being resilient if we are having the same problem over and over again, and we are just letting it pass, but we need to be anti as like, if we had a conflict, then we are not going to have that conflict again, we're just gonna improve.

This is a graph of how antifragility works. I really like it because I want to have an example on this. The idea of immutability in blockchains is a really good idea. But then when you, but then it always comes a breaking point. 

If there were an attack, like what is more important? to keep having the same inability and to not change it, or something that if it changes, then it would become antifragile. I think that this is one of the biggest leaps that had the blockchain ecosystem where they decided to put more importance on the economic consent than the immutability because they innovated.  

That innovation is what is leading to some of the frontier innovations in blockchain. If we would have stayed the same with inability. We change to value this idea of economic consent to be above immutability and that idea is leading us right now to have layer two implementations and roll-up that comes from this innovative idea of economic rather than just immutability. 

Is a really good example because, because immutability is an idea that when it breaks, then you cannot have it again. It's a very fixed idea, but so it's not anti-fragile but to have economic consent is something that we can resist shocks and innovate from them. We had a conflict, we learned from that conflict and that is not going to happen to us again.  

We can see the benefits of having that problem. That now we also care for the cultural build in DAOs and not just like to have a technological organization, that can be like a perfect machine, but it's not friendly to human. 

What we are doing with this cultural builds with this, what I am trying to do with conflict resolution is to help all the ecosystem, to keep themselves in innovating and understanding and learning from past events so that we can use what was wrong in the past to improve in the, in the future.

This is a really good example of antifragile because we sometimes tend to over technologize and underestimate the might of the key of these small wheels and suitcases that will be staring us from the, for the next mile.  

(00:38:16)
You can see that the pots and pans from Pompeii are hardly different from the ones found in today's good kitchen anti-fragile things are things that can stay the same and improve over time. Sometimes when we think on the future, we forget about the things that has been with human life and our human essence and our societies from the start to the end. 

We cannot plan our future without cooking utensils. We should think of our ideas to be indispensable we should think of our ideas as something that can improve with time as something that can resist shocks as something that when in a thousand years that people can still replicate and learn from them and improve them.  

One of the things that I really like about this theory of anti-fragile is, and the way we can see a lot of knowledge in ideas that has, that have been produced and replicated over time, we can also gather information from things that are really old, like world religions. 

(00:49:59)
**Griff**:    So I really like this idea of anti fragility, especially in a conflict management system, but how, what does that look like? What, what does I get the idea, like we should make our conflict management and con trans really focus on the transformational aspect of how to manage the conflict so that it makes it anti-fragile, but what does that actually look like?  

(00:50:29)
**Juan Carlos**:    Well, I think that is a very good question because it, for me, it's been harder, really hard to explain it in an image. I was searching a lot of memes and gifs and how can we like express graphic, graphically anti fragility. 

I really like what he says, that is a property that is within life, and that is within good things and that you can see it when something preserves in time. The, I think also of it as a quality that we have as human being of learning, when we make a mistake, we can learn from it and we can not, not step into the same stone that a lot of times. 

I don't know if maybe I could, I could have had a better answer, but I think it's, it's not something that we can see. Okay. It's not something that we can see, like in, in with the ice, but it's something that we can like study and like, UN understand from, from the capacity of, of change. But I would let do as,  

(00:52:02)
**Durgadas**:    So one, one excellent example of an organized society that actually operates in an antifragile way is India as a whole India itself has been invaded probably a hundred times in the last 5,000 years. 

What ends up happening is actually the people who invade India tend to be kind of absorbed by India because India's philosophy is so radically inclusive that it actually allows for these really disparate viewpoints and continues to remain integral within its itself. 

The principle behind that is a principle called Brahman, which is this conception of a reality beyond all names and forms. That particular thing is considered to be the only actual reality. All of the things which sort of change underneath it are not considered to be real as such. 

Because the entirety of Indian culture is built on top of this fundamental philosophy, it's much easier for the changes which happen on top of it to be absorbed by the culture as a whole. Just a little example there.  

(00:53:29)
**Juan Carlos**:    Well, I think that what I can also say about how can we identify fragility is when things don't like change. I read this, actually, this is the last paragraph of the book of antifragile and it, and he says the best way to verify that you are alive is by variations. I think that variation are antifragile things that don't like variation, they are fragile.

(00:54:35)
**Griff**:    Yeah. I feel, I feel pretty good about it. I mean, I guess I was for more practical around DAOs like, what? I don't know if anyone else in this group has like, seen a anti-fragile con I mean, I guess most DAOs don't have a conflict management pro practice at all, right? Like, it's just like, oh, conflicts get bad. Then we ostracize someone, but I'd curious, anyone can think of any DAOs have a conflict management practice or an aspect that feels anti-fragile?

(00:55:13)
**Speaker 4**:    When there were that drama on sushi swap and somebody took a lot of money and I don't know exactly what happened there. I just heard about it, but I think that if sushi survives after that, it become it's it's antier because it has survived something that could break it. Now it's it learn because people is involved it learn from that. Probably the rest of the space learn from that.  

(00:55:57)
**Juan Carlos**:    Yes. I think that what happens to one DAO every, every other DAO learns from, and I would love that other DAOs start talking about conflict resolution, because I think this is like the, this is small wheels that carry a suitcase that sometimes people like just on their value, but these are things that have been with human societies since this beginning and should have, and should be also in the decentralized world. 

Sometimes we tend to over technology things and like, think that everything can be solved through optimization or that everything can be predicted. We lack sometimes this, this humanness and this understanding of that hearing and listening to the other and incorporating the other point of view and having a dialogue is just one of the basis of our, of how we have a goal O over time. The role of the peace worker in here is, is important. Yes.  

(00:57:09)
**Speaker 5**:    I feel like there, I feel like one hive is actually pretty resilient. We're writing like conflict resolution, I guess, like software and protocols and stuff, but because the community covenant is so radically inclusive and because the lack of hierarchy is basically enforced, if that makes any sense but I mean, there are, there are large holders that voluntarily stay out of like overwhelming the votes and stuff. But the anti fragility in one hive is basically because of the, at this, at this stage is because of the people who are in not enforcing modeling and reminding that everyone is included and all ideas are here to be heard like we don't have a gateway for who can write proposals and stuff like that. It's kind of like, it's, I'm not even gonna begin to say it's the best way to run a deck, but as far as anti fragility, definitely we don't have a, we don't have like a roadmap in goals as much as we have ideals and ways of doing things. I think that really helps.  

(00:58:34)
**Juan Carlos**:    Well, yes, the idea of the, is people that is trained and conscious about the importance of communication and management of conflict and that we can in our social cycles in our communities do good, but well, in this part of the talk, I want, if there other questions, this is the moment because I going workshop. If there is a comment question, please make it
