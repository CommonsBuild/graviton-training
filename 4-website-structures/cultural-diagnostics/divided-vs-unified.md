If you take a look back at the My Stroke of insight, which I mentioned about the unified and divided ways that the, the human brain thinks what you can see is that a lot of times we have these unified and divided ways of thinking. 

If a person is approaching things from a divided standpoint, they're going to tend to have a conflict in when they find themselves in context of a unified system in the, in the spiral, this could be roughly connected to the eye and the we, and as I said, previously, as we evolve along the spiral, you can see how this conflict actually pushes you to evolve.  

That actually will be talked about with some of the other theories of conflict that we have about conflict transformation, which is something that Juan will go into quite a lot in later sessions of this training. 

In any case, I, we mostly put this in here. I did a whole talk about decolonization concerned with figuring out how to take the divided and contextualize it within the unified.

I have on the left a link to the PowerPoint, which talks about this extensively with respect to the unified and divided and a video that goes through about two thirds of the slides in that. 

Part of the thing to understand about the different ways of thinking, and to be able to contextualize it in terms of your evolution, in terms of where people are finding themselves here, contextualize it in terms of how an individual might be found in the spiral, how a person's feelings and needs and ability to make good requests and ability to make good observations is impacted by their own divided in unified thinking. 

### More on Divided\Unified

(00:53:31)
**Juan Carlos**:    I want participate. Add something to the difference between divided and unified thinking and unified thinking is based on understanding that there is no difference between the world we see, and our inner self that's true. When you see the other person, as same as yourself, you won't be able to treat that person badly because you are, you are treating yourself badly. It's the same. 

If you have bad communication with yourself, you will have a bad communication with the other one. The key point of unified and divided thinking is to understand that the world we see is, is a reflection of our inner self. 

It's a reflection of our needs of our, of our state of mind. We should have compassion for the other and for ourselves, because the way we talk to the other persons are, is the same way that we talk to ourselves.  

We need to be very careful with the words we use to communicate. I would love to see the, the explanation that is in the next slide about that, because when you understand that, right and left are just like both ends of the same thing. When you are in the right, you can push to the left. When you are in the left, you can push to the right. That way you can like, overcome the dualities that you see in the world, by the unification of your, of the way you see the thing  

(00:55:28)
**Durgadas**:    That's right now, there's a metaphor that I would use around exactly what he was saying with regard to, what do we consider to be ourselves. So, for example, it's very simple. Sometimes when you go up to scratch your head, you might accidentally poke yourself in the eye.

Everyone's done a dumb thing like that, where you go to do something and you stub your toe, because there wasn't enough mindfulness around what's going on, but nobody would sit there and yell at their finger for poking themselves in the eye As though it were some separate entity because you believe your finger to be a part of your self. 

That is an example of unified thinking. I'm suggesting that if, if suddenly you find somebody poking you in the eye about something, or having a problem with you, or accusing you of something, or, or rather than yelling at your own finger to instead realize that your, your intention is to consider that thing to be a part of yourself.  

Instead of being mad at it, or to create all of this stuff, all of the nonviolent communication framework, all of the spar dynamics thing is to give you ways in which you can find an approach that will make it so that you would imagine that the person or the system or the structure, or the leadership or whatever it is, would be considered to be a part of yourself. 

That's the point of all of this, right? And so there are a lot of ways to do this. All of this talking is really just trying to find different ways that might re resonate with the individuals on the call to give themselves the validation that they need to adopt this unified way of thinking for themselves.

## Tuning Into The Unified

> Unified thinking is based on the understanding that there is no difference between the world we see and our inner self. And that duality comes from within our mind. “The world appears to you, as your mind is.”
> 
> This graphic illustrates the underlying principles of the mind which creates the duality or Maya, called Gunas. 
> 
> With understanding, self-compassion and detachment we can turn the various strategies of abuse into health.

![](https://i.imgur.com/KkSZs72.png)

The final slide here is, is from the Hindu architecture of the mind. I actually talk about this in two of the slides. One is that this is both the architecture of a mistake, and it is the architecture of a solution. 

The way the mind is described in Hindu thinking is that oftentimes when we're caught up in divided thinking, we have almost like those old clocks with the swinging pendulum going back and forth between the veiling part of the mind, the shadow aspect to denied self things that you're denying that are going on. and also swinging over to the projecting part of the mind.  

There's another way you can think about this in terms of likes and dislikes. Now this, this pendulum swinging back and forth between the, the veian projecting power of the mine is called Vic shepa or the tossing of the mine. 

What we're trying to do here in the gravity training is to give you tools and techniques to overcome this, and gradually move the mind toward the so peak way of thinking. 

Now, if you take a look at the Jill Bolty Taylor, Ted talk, one of the things that you'll see is that she talks about the left and the right brain, the divided in the, in the unified, the divide way of thinking really in this situation is the Rajasic and the Tamasic, the projecting power of the mind, the veiling power of the mind, it's all the left brain.  

The side effect part of the mind is the right brain. That's only thinking about now. As you're you progress along your path of understanding and self-compassion and inclusion, there are some side effects. Dispassion is one of them, and it's incredibly, you can actually use dispassion to grow your progress along this upward trajectory. 

Then there's a couple of links in here. Also talking about the una, which is what these are called. Rogers and Thomas are the Gunas and my friend, Dr. Mark, mark Halpern, he's the head of the American college of Veta in nav university, where I used to live ashram is right next to that. The whole idea behind unified thinking is this is actually the way unified thinking can be created. and when I lived in the ashram, we, it had an effect.  

We were taught certain modes of thinking that were more sodic. We were taught modes of eating modes of conducting standpoint also is going toward this sodic way of thinking and this detachment and self-compassion that you can use to break the cycle of going back and forth with this tossing of the mind is, is crucial in how we work as gravitons and people who are trying to resolve conflict. So, are there any questions about this, or Juan, did you wanna add anything to this? I know you really liked this particular slide, so I'd like to hear what you would say about it.  

(01:02:18)
**Juan Carlos**:    Yes. That I read this amazing book that is called Kybalion, and it has 7 principles that are, are very related to this picture. It says all this mind, the universe is mental. As above, below, as below so above. 

This principle embodies the truth, that there is always a correspondence between the laws and phenomena of the virus, of being like nothing, everything moves, everything vibrates, everything is dual and everything has poles. 

Everything has a polar opposite, but, and unlike, and the same that are unlike and the same opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree extremes, meat. Then it says everything flows out and in everything is at, it has its tides. Then it says every cost has its effect. 

Every effect has its cost. What, what I am trying to, to say with this is that there is this state of mind where if you see it from a unified point of view, you will be able to use duality against itself. 

(01:04:10)
**Durgadas**:    Well, so what I'd like you to observe in the macro sense is everything that you see here, all of this explanatory stuff, all of these mental models, these are all exactly similar to what used to be called mythologies. 

Mythologies are not just stories. Mythologies are stories, which they root to them that are, that have complex interlocking relationship based complexities to them. Just like this spiral and mythology actually is intended to introduce the person who's observing them to various approaches that one could, you could see the spiral in multiple different ways. 

It provides about the different ways you can assess the spiral. Mythology is identical to this. Previous mythologies used to be used as a unified framework for imparting vast complex and contextual understandings for multiple levels of learner development and maturity levels along the pathologist of all the roles in individual plays.  

This is an extremely important conceptual framework. The point of it, of having all these mythologies is exactly what Juan just said, which is to use duality against itself to create a unification. Now what this actually does is, and if you talk to subnet a little bit about my discussions with her and with Fabio, the primary thing that we're talking about Fabio and I all the time is how to use duality against itself. 

Now, if you're talking about things in terms of conflict resolution, we're basically doing exactly that for everything. Everything that we're doing here around the conflict resolution cycle is to clarify a person's feelings. 

If they don't know what their feelings are to clarify a person's needs, if they don't know what they are, if clarify, whether a person's making a request or demand, if they don't know when, when they're doing that, or when they're not to clarify when the observa making an observation or making a judgment, that's going to disconnect them or create more conflict.  

If you misidentify your feelings, that's gonna create more conflict because you're gonna be caught up in your head rather than to have any sense of where you actually are. All of the understandings that we come up with use the, the duality and the ignorance and the projections against themselves to create this SOIC way of being in and feeling and thinking. 

Right? so yeah, I, the using duality against itself is, is like the hidden agenda underneath all of these different things, right? Because what we're trying to do is create this unified approach, you know? And so I hope that clarifies that, and this, Hindu approach, I've got some links on the, on the other side to, to help understand how all of that works. This is not exactly related to token engineering, but, but this first thing is just all about how to contextualize all of our future work, so that we have an understanding of the real meaning behind what this conflict resolution slash transformation can actually create.  

## Divided vs Unified

### TWO WAYS TO THINK
**HOW HUMANS ARE HAVING *HUMAN EXPERIENCES* IN A TIMELESS, INFINITE, UNCHANGING REALITY**

[*WATCH: STROKE OF INSIGHT VIDEO*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyyjU8fzEYU)

#### DIVIDED
- Bicameral Brain, Left Side
- Serial Processor, Linear Thought
- PATTERNS, PAST, PROJECTIONS
- Language, Details & Differentiation
- Visual Processing Focused on objects
- CMYK Color Model produces Black
- Externalization of costs
- Ethics

[*WATCH: The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World*](https://youtu.be/SbUHxC4wiWk)

#### UNIFIED
- Bicameral Brain, Right Side
- Parallel Processor, Non-Linear Thought
- NOW, CONTEXT
- CANNOT differentiate
- Visual Processing focused on relationships
- RGB Color Model produces white
- Response-ability

Those of you who saw the video with Jill Bolty Taylor, hopefully it was inspiring for you. I want to speak about this from the perspective of Jill Bolte Taylors, two different ways to think. There's also a link to the stroke of insight video here. 

The divided mind basically thinks in terms of a serial processor with linear thought the right brain as functions, more like a parallel processor with non-linear thought the divided left brain thinks in terms of patterns past and projections, the unified mind on the right side thinks only in terms of now what the now looks like and smells like and tastes like. 

It is the ultimate co contextualize because it literally has no concept of the slightest amount of differences whatsoever. It can't even tell the difference between one thing and another, it only knows about the perpetual. Now the divided mind thinks in terms of language and details and differentiation and more details about all of this, the unified mind can't differentiate.  

As I mentioned before, visual processing of the divided mind, the left mind is focused a lot on objects. Visual processing on the right hemisphere of the brain is much more focused on relationships. We'll get into this more metaphorically. I've included this idea of the difference between the cm, Y K and RGB color models. 

For those of you who have any idea, what that is, the cm YK thing is basically an additive model or a it's added in terms of reflection, cm, YK produces black, whereas RGB monitors from the we're looking at all that in with respect to these monitors produces white. 

It's important to understand how those things work. The only difference between RGB and cm, Y K and the unified and divided mind is that the RGB and cm, Y K can be roughly considered to be a duality. 

Even though there are two ways to think the United unified and divided approaches to thinking should not, I repeat, *should not* be misunderstood as opposing things, the unified mind essentially swallows the entire divided way of thinking in its entirety.

It is the ultimate context in which the divided mind understands and projects itself. From, in terms of a metaphor, you could think about the divided mind is the movie projector, whereas the unified mind is the screen upon which that movie is projected. 

For example, if you project a violent movie with a lot of guns and John WIC activity there, the screen itself does not get full of holes, nor does it take any knife wounds or nor does it bleed. It is in many ways detached from the divided mine, and can't really be affected by that.  

Those of you're familiar with yoga and advice to Viant and other non-dual spiritual philosophies you'll understand that it is in fact, these contexts in which this bicameral mind is allowing us to lend the world. We'll speak about that quite a lot. 

I also put externalization of costs. One of the things that the divided mind will tend to do is to be in denial. It's also the thing, which is responsible for ethics. That is to say that, which concerns me, it's the in individual self. 

If I'm talking about myself in terms of a social context, my choices as relates to what I choose to connect with, for example, you all chose to show up into this group right now, your was your ethical choice to connect with this group and be engaged with this group. Whereas morality is much more of a social thing. 

Then the unified side, we've got responsibility. That is to say, because it is the ultimate co contextualize. It is the thing which gives us the ability to overcome all these divide, divided ways of thinking and generate abilities to respond to things in with detachment and understanding because the unified mind also doesn't have anything like memory it only knows about now. 

### CONTEXT: TWO SOCIAL FORMS
**HOW HUMANS ARE HAVING *SOCIAL EXPERIENCES* IN A TIMELESS, INFINITE, UNCHANGING REALITY**

#### DIVIDED
- Colonizer Worldviews dominate
- Unified Cultures are genocided and appropriated.
- Abrahamic Traditions Objectify Unity (“Sky Gods”)
- Merchants Assess Objects Using “Value” using highly objectified and technical languages like English and - accept only written texts as evidence.
- Creates Hierarchies By Default, Resulting In Violence, holarchies considered impossible.
- Visual Perception & Philosophy Emphasize Individuals & Reductionistic Approaches
- Psychological effects of cultural influences result in increasing narcissism and narcissistic abuse among participants over time.
- Good=Compliance, Evil=Non-Compliance To Social Contract/Hierarchy.

#### UNIFIED
- Pre-Colonization & Highly Unified Worldviews dominate
- Divided Cultures cannot survive and are absorbed through the sheer flexibility and resilience of the approach.
- Shamanic & Dharmic Traditions Contextualize Objects In A Totality
- Citizens Assess Objects in “Relative” ways using contextualized, oral traditions and sonically diverse languages.
- Creates & exists inside holarchies by default. Mechanisms (like the potlatch) exist to flatten the inevitable hierarchies that form.
- Visual Perception & Philosophy Emphasis Contextualizations At Every Level
- Psychological effects result in Overview Effect and relational thinking among participants over time.
- Good=Inclusive Thinking & Behavior, Evil=Exclusive Thinking & Behavior
- Morals

I divide up the social forms of colonizer thinking, basically the divided mind you've got, if you're ratifying and validating the divided mind, you're gonna end up with the colonizer worldview. On the other hand, before, when you had a world that was dominated by unified social forms, you could have somebody like genus con go blazing through your history and still recover from that because the unified worldviews were essentially the most common thing that existed.  

You can see that the divided cultures essentially can't survive for very long, unless they actually colonize really. There are many forms of colonization we'll talk about, but on the other hand, the divided cultures, unified cultures tend to be appropriated and treated poorly. 

Even to the degree, to which they're genocide, you can also take a look at it with respect to the compare and contrast between the divided Abrahamic traditions with their sky gods and the shamonic and dharmic traditions, which basically contextualize the earth, the sky, the universe, the planets, all those things in a totality, as opposed to just a bunch of different objects.

## Merchant Thinking

It's also true that the divided mind basically has been taken over by this merchant thinking. We basically assess objects in divided cultures in divided social forms, using this thing called value. Those values basically are, have to do with like a monetary exchange. 

For those of you who are dealing with things in terms of cryptocurrency and who have encountered me with respect to my perspective on cryptocurrencies, you'll see that what I'm attempting to do is relentlessly contextualize the nature of the work that we're doing in the cryptocurrency space, so that we don't make this a colonizer mistake and to bring forth the legacy code base, which is very much divided.  

### Language

The other thing is that the language itself is incredibly influenced by this merchant's assessing objects using value. It creates a highly technical language that is extremely appropriate for that type of that type of cultural context in which you would assess things like that to the degree, to which we even think of our own psychology and the words we use in our psychology and the entire way that psychology is constructed in our culture. 

I literally mean this from the entire history of psychiatry, and psychology in terms of value and worth. It's actually extraordinary. Once you, once, by the way, I'm just warning you that once you start to see this stuff, it's really difficult to unsee it. This is a bit like the matrix. I'm just warning you ahead of time.  

Juan Carlos gave me about many stories about the process of decolonization on the part of the hundred plus countries that declared independence days from various European colonies. I didn't include any of that later versions of this will include many links to that thing, but I'd just like you to understand that English in particular is a, is an extremely good language for technical topics and is extremely good for mercantilism and other things. Whereas things like Sanskrit are much better at things. In many ways you could think about it in terms of there's additional bifurcation in terms of language.  

It should be noted that Sanskrit is considered the world's most natural language, according to artificial intelligence research. 

## Hierarchy vs Wholarchy
For those of you who are in the crypto AI space, additionally, it, the divided mind tends to create hierarchies by default and basically wholarchies, which are talked about in the Aqua version of spiral dynamics of Ken Wilbur. 

They're largely considered to be impossible just because we've repeated this hierarchical way of thinking. Often that it's almost difficult to think of things in terms of anything other than a series of flatland hierarchical objects, the differentiation between the divided, the unified mine, culturally, cuz we're talking about social forms here.  

## Achieving Unified Thinking

If you read Jonathan hates book, for example, he actually speaks about this too. Even visual perception is affected by this and the inevitable results of carte and thinking for example, are even felt in Al and philosophies and other things. You can see that stuff really clearly. 

Then people who think about things in terms of a unified way of thinking, particularly in recolonized unified cultures, the psychological effect of thinking this way tends to result in inevitably in an overview effect, as opposed to narcissism, which is the inevitable outcome of the divided way of thinking.  

The overview effect you guys may or may not understand is something that is often experienced by astronauts who go up into space and realize that they're going around 19 times a day and everyone who's ever lived and all the drama and politics that have ever occurred. The entire of human history is all this, just this one unified ball. It's this one thing that tends to detach your mind from thinking about things in terms of the divided countries and things, and gives you this overview effect. 

It's possible to achieve that just with yoga and thinking about things relentlessly in terms of a unified approach. It also redefines the nature of good and evil. For example, in Hinduism, good and evil actually don't exist at all. There really just a way of thinking, good would be inclusive thinking and behavior evil is exclusive thinking and behavior, but even then the evil is explained away in terms of the good, the larger good, and so that you can actually see the cultural framework doesn't even accept this so-called classic philosophical problem of evil simply just doesn't exist.  

## Problem of Evil 

The idea that if there was a deity, how could a deity let so many horrible things happen? Well, I'm specifically telling you explicitly that the reason why bad things happen is because of this bifurcation and the cultural emphasis and imbalance that is present in our current culture. That should just be obvious just by watching current events, any questions on the social forum side of this picture?  

## Divided mind creates space for unified

(21:26)    
**Speaker 1**:    You were talking about earlier where like this unified consciousness actually explains a way that divided consciousness and even creates space for it.  

(21:46)    
**Durgadas**:    That's absolutely true. In fact it, what's more than that, it actually allows for the complexity of the divided to be discovered in this comprehensive manner. Right? The, even to the degree to which, and this is talked about maybe in the next slide where you can actually take a look at the intellectual approach. 

### CONTEXT: INTELLECTUAL APPROACHES
**HOW HUMANS ARE HAVING *PHILOSOPHICAL&PERCEPTUAL* EXPERIENCES IN A TIMELESS, INFINITE, UNCHANGING REALITY**

#### DIVIDED
- Educational system focused on external objects given positive value by the society, not the student nor the mind of the student; nor “Reality” itself.
- Materialistic Worldviews dominate (Science Delusion) and limit the available evidence, focusing on patho-myths and denialism.
- Objectivity and Subjectivity are misunderstood as “a very very very long list of objects” and individual perception is completely denied, dismissed and distrusted rather than understood.
- Unified Cultures are appropriated, demeaned and degraded, resulting in enormous misunderstandings and failure to benefit from the syncretic approach they possess. 
- Focus On “Being Right” within the hierarchy’s ‘value’ system. “Right” (according to the social contract) is PARAMOUNT ABOVE ALL ELSE. Therefore “beliefs” supersede all other rationality.
- Intellectuals Assess Concepts, Values, and Objects Using “Value”, based on the orthodoxy of their culture, resulting in an imbalance of thinking. Extending the senses is a primary means of knowledge.
- “Hard Sciences” preferred due to materialist bias, while psychology and even history are seen through the rigid orthodoxies that actively subvert and prevent their understanding.
- Visual Perception & Philosophy Emphasize Individuals & Reductionistic Approaches above all else: DESCARTES: “I think, therefore I am.”

#### UNIFIED
- Educational system focused on the student, and their mind’s ‘lensing’ of Reality and their roles within themselves, the family unit, the social fabric and the world and the universe itself; forming a cohesive approach to both inner and outer life.
- Mythologies are used as unified frameworks for imparting vast, complex and contextual understandings for multiple levels of learner development and maturity levels along the path to knowledge of all the roles an individual plays, as previously mentioned.
- The apparent division between Objectivity and Subjectivity in perception was solved thousands of years ago.
- Divided Cultures are understood to be immature expressions of a whole, even while suffering under the abuse they mete out.
- Subverting “belief” altogether is a primary means of knowledge. “The Knowledge That, Being Known, Nothing Else Remains To Know.”
- Intellectual activity is validated and contextualized in terms of being balanced between openness and discrimination.
- Creates & exists inside holarchies by default. 
- Visual Perception & Philosophy Emphasis Contextualizations At Every Level: Advaita Vedanta: “I Am, Therefore I Think”, since existence precedes Thought.

## Lord Ramma
The thing that I'm talking about here is that the word myth has been largely corrupted by the divided way of thinking and educational thinking. What mythologies actually are, is very much like spiral dynamics. You can think of, for example, this deity behind me, Lord Ramma. 

Lord Rama would be a framework upon which you can project an a truly staggering amount of complexity to the point of understanding astronomy psychology. It just goes on and on. Then the relationships between the different characters in these things also then elucidate other kinds of mythological relationships. This is true to a degree that it said that the Maha Brata contains every possible human experience.  

The largest book really in existence beyond that it is an oral tradition. If you carry this into the intellectual side of the picture, what you can see is in many ways, the approach of science on the left side. I've got some links to Rupert Sheldrake's science delusion, which talks about some of these things and his advice around approaches to unify science again. 

## Education focused on external objects

The educational system in the divided cultural context is exclusively focused on external objects.

There'll be links to Marshall Rosenberg's audio book. He actually speaks about how he went through like 20 plus years of including like a PhD. He was never once asked how he felt about participating in that system. Basically the thing that I'm attempting to show is that the educational system of the divided is one that has a giant hole in the middle. 

That giant hole in the middle is you. Whereas the educational system of a unified way of thinking is exclusively focused on the student and their mind's relationship with the external and how they have to play these different roles within their relationship with themselves. 

To understand their shadow selves and other things, how they have their relationship with their family unit, but the social fabric, the world itself, and then the larger diffuse mysterious universe.  

By paying attention to how the mind lenses reality one can actually gain an understanding, not only about the, a deeper understanding about the nature of the external reality that the divided mind's trying to talk to you about, but also about your relationship with it.  

## other assertions that the divided intellectual approach takes

There's also some other assertions that the divided intellectual approach takes. For example, they tend to completely distrust the mind and, to people like who's the well there's Richard Dawkins, but he has a, there's a magician guy in Britain. What's his name, Darren brown, who likes to show the fundamental problems with the perception. And that's the divided way of thinking. 

Whereas the unified mind solved the problem of objectivity and subjectivity several thousand years ago, we don't have to keep going on television to point out the fact that this subjectivity objectivity problem exists. We, and you can't actually solve these subjectivity objectivity issue with a divided form of thinking. It requires that you adopt and ratify a unified way of thinking. 

Additionally, the divided way of thinking has a crucial flaw in that what you believe is the primary thing your beliefs, it's gotten to the point, I've almost got 5,000 answers on core. At this point, it's gotten to the point where I won't even answer a question with the word belief in it. 

It doesn't make any sense at all, because I have a unified approach, which includes the unified and then divided, but I'm just tired of answering people whose minds are completely taken over by the divided. I would rather speak to people who have at least an inkling of the nature of the unified way of thinking. 

It's also true that divided cultures are understood by unified cultures as immature expressions of a whole, even while suffering under the abuse that the divided cultures have given out in the last thousand years. One of the primary approaches about unified knowledge is to subvert belief altogether.  

This is the primary means of knowledge for a unified thinker. There's a story about the traditional way to deal with the guru system is that a parent would send its their child a way to an ashram or to a local teacher at age eight. They would return at age 20. 

The real question, the only real question that needs to be answered by this student when they come back to their parents, is did you learn the knowledge that being known, nothing else remains to know. 

This is very clear evidence of a cultural, a framework, which sets up the unified approach to thinking versus being right adhering to a social contract, adhering to the various levels of hierarchy. Even with intellectuals, they assess concepts, values, and objects using this term value generally based on the orthodoxy of their culture, inevitably resulting in an imbalance of thinking.  

To the degree that scientists themselves tend to hard sciences versus psychology or like history it's unbelievable the degree to which history has been revised, not only due to the horrific nature of colonization, but also just everything else. Take a look at the pyramids. They used saws. There's no way to, what I'm saying?, sorry, that just happened. We've got this whole revisionist history that says that couldn't have happened. There's just, it's all about reductionist approaches, whereas the unified intellectual approach would prioritize contextualization above all other things and the whole Cartesian way of thinking. Therefore I am is actually seen correctly in non-dual Viant as I am first, therefore because existence precedes thought, and this is an incredibly important differentiation.  

### Radical Inclusivity
(00:59:14)
**Speaker 6**:    Have quickly comment on what both Doga does. Matt Verde talked about radical inclusivity. I think this is key for antifragility. I was thinking, what comprises radical inclusivity? Like, what do you need to have a radical inclusive environment? And the few topics I listed is accessible information, active listening bureaucracy. That is a freedom of agency. I'd be curious if anyone has other ideas about this.  

(00:59:58)
**Juan Carlos**:    I think that you unified thinking because to see ourselves as a whole and to not see ourselves divided from the other is what, what leads leaves us to see the other as, as a peer and as some, one that can contribute to the dialectical process that we are, that we are in, in the moment. I would say like to see ourselves as a whole, and to not see the other person as, as different as one, but to see, to understand that everyone of us is having our own struggles and doing the best that we can to achieve our purposes. and I look at, I like radical inclusion because that's why I'm here.  

(01:00:52)
**Durgadas**:    One other thing I would say is part of the reason why I sort of describe myself as a relentless co contextualize is because I do feel like in every situation, the radical inclusivity is basically a habit of continuous and endless and relentless contextualization, which is to say sort of figuring out how two things are more similar or more common with each other than they are different. To have that be my first priority, when I'm cogni about any given topic, that's the most important thing that's, that's for me is kind of a personal habit, which I am sort of attempting to through various means and my involvement with gravity and other communities to foster as a habit among the people within those communities.  

# trust creation

(00:25:35)    
**Juan Carlos**:    For sure.The idea is to be able to bring communities and community members together, even in this agreement. What we are trying to do is also to normalize talking about conflicts and that makes us more competent to deal with it. 

If we never talk about conflict in an organization, when conflict happens, everyone is gonna start running and pulling their hair without knowing what to do. It's important to understand that in these type of organizations, we need to have some justice systems and that everywhere you go, where there is a social organization, or like a group of people there's gonna be a justice system. 

It can be an invisible justice system that no one talks about. Not having a justice system is also a justice system.  

What we are trying to do is to recognize the importance of having a justice system to have yeah. Credibility and build trust over coordination in these type of communities. We can have several types of justice systems, but the justice system that we are trying to promote is based on mutual monitoring. 

When we were reading Ostrom, she says, it's very expensive to have like external monitors monitoring the actions of a community. What we are trying to do is to build competence within people in the community, so that the people inside the community act as peers supporting each other. 

That's why we're developing these skills. The training has like a lot of topics. We are starting with that contextualization and talking about creating trust, because, without trust, you cannot solve conflict. 

You have to trust that there is a system that is not biased in order for you to rely that the, that system is going to be ju fair with you and that it's not going to it's not going to influence the outcome of a decision.  

(00:28:36)    
**Durgadas**:    Those principles in particular are to care for the commons. What you'll notice is out in the centralized world, there is these pockets of greed and everything. That is now extended off into the commons too. You end up with the prisoners' dilemma and the tragedy of the commons and the fundamental principle of token engineering and what this was founded on was those from principles. 

The developmental thinking has come after, as a contextualize for that thing, but to care for the commons is part of that process as well. We don't just care about the commons we care about all the individual people. That's why principal C exists where we talk in terms of nonviolent communication, holding space for signal inside of noise, avoiding enemy image creation, and making sure that we're dealing with people in a humanistic fashion. 

What you'll notice is, as you move through this process is that the legality and the formality of this thing escalates as you start from principle A and go around to principle D.  

It's true that we need larger contextualizing principles and on the trust creation side being able to understand all these different things in terms of the first principle being also able to care for the commons, which is that part if you have two people in a relationship, there's a third thing, which is in the middle, which is the commons. 

If you're married, you have yourself and your partner, and then you have all your shared relationship and property and kids and all these other things in between you and it's caring for that. That is principle B and a lot of that negotiation and other things as principal C. 

Then when things really aren't working, we then go into principal but at each aspect of this, we're trying to transform the conflict into something which is greater so that we can get back to the first principle. Is that reasonable?  

(00:31:07)    
**Juan Carlos**:    In this organizations where there is so much of a technological focus, sometimes we forget about the humanity and the human side and the human aspect of it. I feel that more and more, we are starting to talk about this because, these organizations are not only like enterprises, these organizations are also communities and these important for community members to support each other. 

In this context where we are spending so much time with people, we cannot feel that we only work and that we don't know the people who we are working with. Like we only know we only see avatars and we don't know about what the other persons struggle is. Our intention with this services is for people to request support in a variety of situations.  

Not only we have conflict with other people, sometimes we have internal conflict or sometimes we just want some advice of someone that can hear us in a safe space, and we need to develop that trust and that confident between people. 

The idea is that the people that pass this training can be seen in the community as an easy access agent to request support in a variety of situations. Yeah, it is to enforce and to power empower the human aspect of dos. We cannot have like organizations that exploit the human or that they are not comprehensive to human needs, but rather we need to have more comprehensive dos and for people to have an and joyful experience by participating.  

(00:33:22)    
**Durgadas**:    And so, in terms of second order stuff, part of the thing to understand is that it gives you an advantage as an employee, as an employer, as a DAO to have this thing, anchoring your culture and it's a really excellent skill both personally and professionally, and as a cultural context to have this entire framework understood. Is there anything else you have, Juan?

(00:34:03)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I just would like to say that also, and this is something that I'm going to talk in my next session, but that in this organizations, we also reproduce and organization identity of false self, where, everyone should be happy. Everyone should be always available to carry more load of work. 

Sometimes we are false. We don't voice out our concerns. The idea of having Gravity in an organization is also to be able to have a safe space, to communicate and yeah. To talk about the things that normally we don't talk about and to feel that if something seems unfair, that there is people that is caring for the experience in people in their organization. 

Not only, okay, we are going to exploit people and, we only care for you because if you work for us, but if you stop working for us, we don't care. Why not even, why did you stop like contributing? 

We see a lot of conflicts between members in organizations, but it's not only important to be able to provide support in a professional way mediation when they dispute scale. That's why we are starting with this, but it's also important to have like a cultural understanding and a cultural effort to build trust and to build relationships and to build credibility within the system. 

That's why it's so important to have safe spaces to integrate and to let people like feel that their concerns can be expressed, because if we don't foster feedback, or if we don't have safe spaces for people to communicate, there will be a lot of things that will happen. We will, they will never be voiced out. 

People wont feel comfortable if they don't have one, a safe space to communicate. Warranties of that, what they're communicating will be processed as an input to the system.  

(00:36:49)    
**Durgadas**:    One of the things you'll notice is if you looking at this complicated graphic as trust creation is a general principle, it also has an impact on security. If we're creating token engineers and improving the lives of token engineers and teaching from an ethical standpoint we do in many of our technical things that the point of this is that we're dealing with money here. 

We're making tokens and things. Trust creation is almost the most important thing about this thing that we're talking about. Right. To having the reason why people put their money in banks is because they trust, they have a level of trust about that. 

It's not just for the participation in the token engineering or an individual DW, but also just for the overall ethical culture and promotion of ethical culture within this particular area of work.
