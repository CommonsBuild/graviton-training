* [Why is Gravity relevant in Token Engineering?](https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/why-is-gravity-relevant-in-token-engineering-e28ae4a5b5a1)
  > When we talk about Gravity in the context of Token Engineering, we refer to a decentralized group of people that embody a cyber physical force whose ultimate purpose is to pull community members (and DAOs) toward each other.
  > 
  > Gravity is the name of a trust creation & conflict management initiative born from the Token Engineering Commons, where we are training individuals to encourage synthesis from dialogue and transform distress into opportunities for improvement.
  > 
  > We promote methods for peacefully addressing conflict as something needed for the success of organizations, its continued sustainability and its ongoing evolution.

The trainings are held in the [Gravity-TEC](https://discord.gg/kxTxG8bh37) Discord voice channel.

## About Graviton Training

* [Gravity Training, Voting Underway & Intrinsic Motivation and Rewards](https://medium.com/token-engineering-commons/voting-underway-gravity-training-intrinsic-motivation-rewards-4609dcb10f03)
  > this training will include:
  > 1. Nonviolent communication & spiral dynamics — Trust creation
  > 2. Theories of conflict, Antifragility and conflict transformation
  > 3. BATNA, Negotiation and Alternative Dispute Resolution
  > 4. Role plays & simulations for conflict management
  > 5. Soft Governance & culture: Ostrom’s principles for enduring CPR institutions
  > 6. Gravity process deep dive (ADR for DAOs)
  > 
  > Gravitons will receive [POAP certificates](https://www.poap.xyz/) [[POAP on Medium](https://medium.com/@poap)] at the end of each session. After they have completed the course they can take a leadership role in the Gravity Working Group.

  > The graviton is the hypothetical quantum of gravity, an elementary particle that mediates the force of gravity.
  > 
  > This short course aims to help those in the TEC understand cultural principles we wish to nurture, in the community. It promotes the philosophy of nonviolent communication (NVC) for a deeper understanding conflict and tools to peacefully manage conflict (internally, individually and collectively), with the purpose of promoting trust into our shared rules and boundaries.
  > 
  > ### Gravitons shall be able to
  > 0. Make an effort to be present and accessible to the community, bringing high vibes and improving relationships, bringing the community together.
  > 1. Separate the people from problems. Making parties identify with themselves and the other as equals, rather than centering on their own conflictive thoughts-feelings.
  > 2. Self-determinate from all parties and recognize key management points by analyzing the information gathered.
  > 3. Promote empathy between conflicting parties with emotional intelligence. Building proximity from the abstraction of the problem and the humanization of apparent antithesis.
  > 4. Adapt their mindset for tolerance to conflictive situations, keeping calm and diplomacy to stand as an independent third party.
  > 5. Propose alternatives to deal with paradoxes while looking for the coexistence and attraction of opposites.
  > 6. Act according to institutional regulations while implementing actions to frame unwanted behavior within rules and boundaries (Terms & conditions / Codes of conduct / Graduated sanctions)

## Plan of Study

  > The TEC has its own tailored rules and boundaries, which are co-created and translated into protocols, processes and guidelines that are made to follow our values, take care of our system and regulate autonomously. 
* [Gravity - Role Design](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/gravity-role-design/174)
  > We are proposing a mutual-monitoring system, where each one of us can inform any issue (through the Gravity Typeform) to a designated group of members in the community, that will assume the following responsibilities:
  > 
  > a) As individuals, to promote dialogue within the organization and manage conflicts addressed through ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution),\
  > b) As a collective, to take decisions on the implementation of graduated sanctions.\
  > c) As both a collective and individuals, to commit to the practice of preventing, contextualizing and resolving disputes by regular attendance in our community practice.
