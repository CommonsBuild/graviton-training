## About Graviton Training

[Juankbell - GRAVITON TRAINING](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/graviton-training/217) - ANN TECommons Forum

The graviton is the hypothetical quantum of gravity, an elementary particle that mediates the force of gravity.

This short course aims to help those in the TEC understand cultural principles we wish to nurture, in the community. It promotes the philosophy of nonviolent communication (NVC) for a deeper understanding conflict and tools to peacefully manage conflict (internally, individually and collectively), with the purpose of promoting trust into our shared rules and boundaries.

### Gravitons shall be able to
0. Make an effort to be present and accessible to the community, bringing high vibes and improving relationships, bringing the community together.
1. Separate the people from problems. Making parties identify with themselves and the other as equals, rather than centering on their own conflictive thoughts-feelings.
2. Self-determinate from all parties and recognize key management points by analyzing the information gathered.
3. Promote empathy between conflicting parties with emotional intelligence. Building proximity from the abstraction of the problem and the humanization of apparent antithesis.
4. Adapt their mindset for tolerance to conflictive situations, keeping calm and diplomacy to stand as an independent third party.
5. Propose alternatives to deal with paradoxes while looking for the coexistence and attraction of opposites.
6. Act according to institutional regulations while implementing actions to frame unwanted behavior within rules and boundaries (Terms & conditions / Codes of conduct / Graduated sanctions)

## Plan of Study
### Weekly pattern
1. Gravitons read the resources presented
2. Gravitons answer the Questions
3. Gravitons attend the Class
4. Gravitons review/improve their Answers
5. Gravitons receive a “grade” each class for their answers and their participation.
6. Resources to read for the next week are promoted

* [Gravity - Role Design](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/gravity-role-design/174)
  > We are proposing a mutual-monitoring system, where each one of us can inform any issue (through the Gravity Typeform) to a designated group of members in the community, that will assume the following responsibilities:
  > 
  > a) As individuals, to promote dialogue within the organization and manage conflicts addressed through ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution),\
  > b) As a collective, to take decisions on the implementation of graduated sanctions.\
  > c) As both a collective and individuals, to commit to the practice of preventing, contextualizing and resolving disputes by regular attendance in our community practice.
