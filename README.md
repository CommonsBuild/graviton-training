# Gravity DAO Archive

This repository contains an archive of resources related to Gravity DAO (which originated within the Token Engineering Commons).

Previously this repository contained only graviton training study materials, and discord chatlogs.. now all of the Gravity DAO info is being aggregated to this one place.

  > Gravitons shall be able to:
  > - Make an effort to be present and accessible to the community, bringing high vibes and improving relationships, bringing the community together.
  > - Separate the people from problems. Making parties identify with themselves and the other as equals, rather than centering on their own conflictive thoughts-feelings.
  > - Self-determinate from all parties and recognize key management points by analyzing the information gathered.
  > - Promote empathy between conflicting parties with emotional intelligence. Building proximity from the abstraction of the problem and the humanization of apparent antithesis.
  > - Adapt their mindset for tolerance to conflictive situations, keeping calm and diplomacy to stand as an independent third party.
  > - Propose alternatives to deal with paradoxes while looking for the coexistence and attraction of opposites.
  > - Act according to institutional regulations while implementing actions to frame unwanted behavior within rules and boundaries (Terms & conditions / Codes of conduct / Graduated sanctions)
