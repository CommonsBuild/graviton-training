  > Gravitons shall be able to:
  > - Make an effort to be present and accessible to the community, bringing high vibes and improving relationships, bringing the community together.
  > - Separate the people from problems. Making parties identify with themselves and the other as equals, rather than centering on their own conflictive thoughts-feelings.
  > - Self-determinate from all parties and recognize key management points by analyzing the information gathered.
  > - Promote empathy between conflicting parties with emotional intelligence. Building proximity from the abstraction of the problem and the humanization of apparent antithesis.
  > - Adapt their mindset for tolerance to conflictive situations, keeping calm and diplomacy to stand as an independent third party.
  > - Propose alternatives to deal with paradoxes while looking for the coexistence and attraction of opposites.
  > - Act according to institutional regulations while implementing actions to frame unwanted behavior within rules and boundaries (Terms & conditions / Codes of conduct / Graduated sanctions)
