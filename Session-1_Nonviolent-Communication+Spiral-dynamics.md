A selection of quotes, images and other materials gathered from the session notes, [#🕊️-TEC-Gravity](https://discord.gg/rThJFgxqgM), [Graviton Training](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15UvsnS9oX5czAKIGHZUqJLhrORpPebWsZeCqmUz9BUE/edit#slide=id.gabe59e4cc3_0_16) on Google Slides, and the web. The idea is to make it easier to navigate this content, and explore the topics covered more deeply.

## Nonviolent Communication

**a) [Brief summary of Non Violent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg](https://srinathramakrishnan.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/non-violent-communication-summary.pdf)**

This is a chapter outline of key points related in Marshall Rosenberg's [Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life](https://puddledancer.bookstore.ipgbook.com/nonviolent-communication--a-language-of-life--3rd-edition-products-9781892005281.php). (PuddleDancer Press)

> If "violent" means acting in ways that result in hurt or harm, then much of how we communicate—judging others, bullying, having racial bias, blaming, finger pointing, discriminating, speaking without listening, criticizing others or ourselves, name-calling, reacting when angry, using political rhetoric, being defensive or judging who's "good/bad" or what's "right/wrong" with people—could indeed be called "violent communication." 

> Nonviolent Communication is the integration of four things: 
> * Consciousness: a set of principles that support living a life of compassion, collaboration, courage, and authenticity  
> * Language: understanding how words contribute to connection or distance  
> * Communication: knowing how to ask for what we want, how to hear others even in disagreement, and how to move toward solutions that work for all  
> * Means of influence: sharing "power with others" rather than using "power over others"  

> Nonviolent Communication serves our desire to do three things: 
> * Increase our ability to live with choice, meaning, and connection
> * Connect empathically with self and others to have more satisfying relationships
> * Sharing of resources so everyone is able to benefit

  > All human beings have an innate capacity for compassion, but it is easy to become detached from this capacity in our pursuit to get our way. But when we get our way through fear, guilt, shame, or coercion, we are just as likely to suffer as those who give in to our will.
  > 
  > Violent communication need not be malevolent; often, it is automatic and habitual. In this article, we will explore Nonviolent Communication (NVC), a process through which we can learn to express ourselves clearly and honestly while listening to our needs and others.
