## Three Influential Models 
Frequently used models to provide a foundation for recommending state or market solution to governing public goods. 

### The Tragedy of the Commons 

“What is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it, Everyone thinks chiefly of his own, hardly at all the common interest” Aristotle

“Hobbes parable of man in a state of nature is a prototype of the tragedy of the commons: Men seek their own good and end up fighting one another.

“Wealth that is free for all is valued by no one, because he who is foolhardy enough to wait for its proper time of use will only find that it has been taken by another” Gordon  
1- Individualism vs collaboration. Harmed sense of community and belonging  
2- lack of shared values   
3- lack of trust, security, fear of being ridiculed. Vulnerability is seen as weakness  —--- vs reciprocity 

### Prisoner's Dilemma 

“In a prisoner's dilemma game, each player has a dominant strategy in the sense that the player is always better off choosing this strategy, no matter what the other player chooses.”

“The paradox that individually rational strategies lead to collectively irrational outcomes seems to challenge a fundamental faith that rational human beings can achieve rational results.” 
Feeling like there are no choices to exit the system 
1- Cooperating beyond rational choices - ratio, quantitative. 
2- adding qualitative variables

### The Logic of collective action 

“One who cannot be excluded from obtaining the benefits of a collective good once the good is produced has little incentive to contribute voluntarily to the provision of that good” 

“Olson considers it an open question whether intermediate-size groups will or will not voluntarily provide collective benefits. His definition of it depends not on the number of actors involved but on how noticeable each person’s actions are.” 

1- well being as the incentive to contribute voluntarily
2 - transparency not only to monitor, but to be seen. 
3 - positive monitoring

## 8 Principles for Governing the Commons 

1. Clearly defined boundaries
2. Congruence between appropriation and provision
3. Collective choice arrangements
4. Monitoring 
5. Graduated sanctions
6. Conflict resolution mechanisms
7. Minimal recognition of rights to organize
8. Nested enterprises 

Creating alternatives about the problems above 
The relationship between rules, graduated sanctions and conflict resolution mechanisms 

#### The source of violence is the choices you didn’t know you could make - Dominic Barter 

#### Self-violence and self-conflict are the root of collective conflicts. 

1. Identify 

What ways people treat you that you really don't like? 
Are there uncomfortable states you feel often because the way you were/are treated? 

2. Question

Start a self dialogue. 
Build questions for you to answer
In a scale of 1-10 how much this affects you?   
Learning the path for self discovery will help on guiding others 

3. Take ownership back 

Make new choices 
To yourself, informed by yourself 
  
#### Learning the path for self discovery will help on guiding others 

#### Self knowledge is the path to agency, cooperation, confidence, ability to support yourself and others and the way to find your true motivations. All very important aspects to govern our commons. 

## Forgiving Rules

> “If individuals make honest mistakes or face personal problems that occasionally prevent them from following a rule do not have access to mechanisms that will allow them to make up for their lack of performance in an acceptable way, rules may come to be viewed as unfair, and conformance rates may decline.”

> “The way in which rules are enforced is forgiving of occasional lapses and errors and allows appropriators to avoid the high costs that can result from rigid application of uniform rules in a changing and uncertain environment”

## Monitoring 

> “When the rules in use conform to the design principles discussed in chapter 3 (enabling individuals to design rules that will keep monitoring costs low) and individuals adopt contingent strategies, individuals are also motivated to monitor each other to obtain the information they need to pursue this contingent strategy.” 

> “If individuals begin monitoring others and learn that others comply most of the time with a set of rules, they are more likely to be willing to adopt and/or continue contingent strategies.” 
Preventive rather than reactive. 
Transparent.

**Speaker 0**:    Thanks, Juan, not sure. Maybe it's easier to just turn off the video now. If more people want to join, they can join. Okay.  

(00:00:33)    
**Speaker 2**:    Really, can you share the link to this slides?  

(00:00:38)    
**Speaker 0**:    Yeah, I'll share. I would rather we go together through them though, and in the end I can post the link.  

(00:00:50)    
**Speaker 2**:    Okay. Okay. Sorry.  

(00:00:52)    
**Speaker 0**:    No problem. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you all for joining. I'll just give a brief introduction of what we're gonna be going through today. I'm calling this having relational insights to govern comments and the TC has been the PC cultural build has been built over Ostrom's eight principles. Soft Govan culture has been working to implement the eight principles into our cultural build. We've been having so many insights from this, and I just want to share some of them with you, and also to honor all of this course as has been happening and all of the speakers that has spoke so far. It's been very beautiful to see everyone's commitment and everyone's showing up here every week. Yeah, we'll have a little exercise of presence. I would just ask for everyone who is unmuted to please mute yourself, cuz I can hear some feedback. Thank you.  

(00:02:14)    
**Speaker 0**:    We'll have a little exercise of presence and then go into the relational clues from the three influential models that are very present in Ostrom's book and then go into the eight principles and have an individual exercise. Then if we have time, we're gonna go into breakout rooms and return for a final round. If we don't have time, we'll still have the individual exercise and some collective sharing in the end for whoever feels comfortable for it. The exercise I want to propose is a bit of a challenge, but I believe in us, we can do it.  

(00:02:59)    
**Speaker 0**:    I think, for me, at least I've been, this is my fourth hour of consecutive call and I know how sometimes cream can affect our presence and our ability to be here and listening. I'm from a theater background and we used to do this exercise a lot, but it's very simple, just arriving in a space and saying I am and my name. I am Lidia. Just saying your name out loud really brings you to presence. Also another thing is being aware of space and time. Here is particularly challenging because we are in a virtual space and the time of, I don't know, unmuting muting can be a little chaotic, but I want to propose this to do this. We're not gonna call up next on no one. We're gonna fill in when one to say, I am an RNA and I really hope that everyone here can do that. Your name means, however you like to be called. I'll say it and then someone else will pick up next and someone else will pick up next and someone else will pick up next and hopefully we'll get the whole room pretty quickly just to get started. I am li  

(00:04:30)    
**Speaker 1**:    I am Dedo. I am Carlos I Jean, I am huddles. I Morgan. I am Christopher. I am Maggie I'm I am Lux. I'm Peter I'm TA I'm Nathan. Hi, Brittany, 

(00:05:47)    
**Speaker 0**:    Please  

(00:05:51)    
**Speaker 1**:    All  

(00:06:10)    
**Speaker 0**:    Thank you, everyone. I trust that everyone who feels comfortable to speak up that you did and if you don't feel like speaking up, it's okay too. Maybe just say it for yourself in there that you are who you are and you are here in present and we can get started. Ostrom's book is really based on those two main topics of, Hey writer. Can you please mute yourself? Thank you, Olivia. Morgan. Be possible to put it on presentation mode so we can see it a little bigger. Yes, absolutely. Thank you. The three influential models is what is one of the foundations of governing the comments? The three influential models and also the eight principles for governing the comments and on the three influential models is basically the foundational of what the state and the market have been using to say the importance of using either the state or the market to govern public goods.  

(00:07:42)    
**Speaker 0**:    While in reality, here we are trying to find a different path. We're not building systems that are similar to either the state or the market. Or the private institutions, the Mar when I say market, of private companies, we're trying to build a third path that is of shared ownership of self-governing communities. The DAO space can be considered commons. There are so many public goods that are considered commons and governing this public goods has been the biggest challenge in humanity and organization being at the core of this. That's why it's so important that we look into them. Before I was sorry, I'm just gonna exit quickly to see some of the speaker notes, but maybe I can make it bigger. Somehow.  

(00:08:47)    
**Speaker 0**:    Maybe that's better. Previously I looked into this three influential models explaining them, but we're not gonna like go too deep into them right now, but I wanted to look into the insights that they offer on relational aspects. The tragedy of the comments, maybe many of you have heard about already. I picked three phrases that is amplify what the tragedy of the commons is. From here, we're gonna look into, what is under the lines, what is being said without fully being said, how this phrases of the people who wrote this models can give us insights about the values of the communities, of the systems that they were being built at. What is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it. Everyone thinks chiefly of his own highly at all, the common interest there was, this was Atel who said long time ago.  

(00:09:58)    
**Speaker 0**:    What is implicit in this phrase is that individualism is what is dominant whenever he wrote this. If I only think chiefly of my own and highly at the common interest is because there is very little room for collaboration in the society values. There is a harm sense of community and belonging. Then the second point of hopes, parable of a man in a state of nature is a prototype of the tragedy of the commons. He says that men seek their own good and end up fighting one another. This is another example of individualism and also lack of shared values because if you seek your own good and that leads you to fight one another is because your own good is not the good of the other. There is a lack of community, again, a lack of belonging, and this brings violence.  

(00:11:07)    
**Speaker 0**:    And at the third point, wealths, that is free for all is valued by no one because he who is full hearted enough to wait for its proper time of view will only find that he has been taken by another. This is one of my favorite ones in terms of how much psychological insights this give because he who is full hearty enough is this sense of being ridiculed is a lack of trust is vulnerability seen as weakness. It's like the opposite of reciprocity. How does in a very personal level affect so deeply the system that people who believe in this individually are answered. So the prisoner's dilemma is another model. All of them are very related to the tragedy of the commons, but are like different ways of observing the same type of tragedy. In a prisoner's dynamic game, each player has dominant strategy in the sense that the player is always better off choosing this strategy, no matter what the other player chooses.  

(00:12:18)    
**Speaker 0**:    This is lack of communication is also lack of trust and feeling like there are no choices to exit the system. It's in the name already that it's a prisoner's dilemma. If this is in the core of the systems that we are inserted in right now, all of those conversations we have about freedom, it makes sense this distance that we have from the concept of freedom, because we are in so many prisoners dilemmas, we are leaving this lack of communication, lack of coordination, lack of community, and the feeling of impotence the feeling of I can't exit the system. There's something I learned in game theory, also that a game is considered a good game when it's easy for you to it's as easy for you to exit as it is for you to enter. You should have that ability of choosing when you want to be playing something.  

(00:13:20)    
**Speaker 0**:    And when you don't, you don't want to be playing something. We've been playing a system for too long that we didn't have the choice to be playing. Then the second is the paradox that individually irrational strategies lead to collective irrational outcomes seems to challenge a fundamental faith that rational human beings can achieve rational results. This, the etymology of the word rational comes from ratio. That is quantitative aspect. If we look into humans from a quantitative perspective, rather than a qualitative variable, then we are undermining so many of our characteristics and thinking like we fit a box that we don't fit. This is a problem that academia constantly has in relation to empirical experiments, because there is so much of the theory that just doesn't fit reality. Then we build models based on the theory and those models just don't work.  

(00:14:33)    
**Speaker 0**:    But then we need to keep cutting ourselves literally to fit into the systems. Then the logic of collective action is most known is the free writer problem. One who cannot be excluded from obtaining the benefits of a collective good once the good is produced, has little incentive to contribute voluntarily to the provision of that. Good. What is the incentive to contribute voluntarily to something like what makes you want to do something, even though you're already receiving benefits from it? There is a big question of wellbeing about how people feel pleasure in places about how people feel, seeing how they feel like they belong. How can bonds be created?  

(00:15:28)    
**Speaker 0**:    There is an experiment. I love that a musician made where he went through all over the world, got connected with people from more than 25 languages. All of them expressed that they wanted to be loved and that they wanted to be happy and that they wanted to be healthy. Like all of these basic things that are from like very much the human existence. If these things are being provided voluntary actions come voluntarily. This is definitely a big missing piece of the systems that we've been working on coming from the state and the market also considers it an open question, whether intermediate size groups will or will not voluntarily provide collective benefits. His definition of it depends not on the number of actions involved, but on how noticeable each person's actions are. This is also another indicator of how important it is for people to be seen. In this sense, from where he's coming from, he's speaking more about like a surveillance type of state, where people were seen in a way that they don't want to be seen. Then when you shift this to all of the other values that we were speaking about, and you bring this eyes to someone with love and with acceptance and with belonging, we can have very beautiful effects of this voluntaryism and the collective benefits that everyone can have by being seen.  

(00:17:16)    
**Speaker 0**:    From this, I want to jump into the, a principles for governing the comments that has been guiding so much of our work. I'll just go very briefly between them and maybe you can identify them on like practical examples of things that you live in your lives. If you're an active member of the TC, also thinking about, oh, where are they present? How are they being shaped in the TC? Clearly defined boundaries. It's just being able to exclude people from appropriating something or having clear directions of who can appropriate resources in that system and who can't. In the TC we've been using the trusted seed for the initialization of our economy. Only aligned individuals could participate in the hatch, only people that wanted to advance token engineering as a field and not look for immediate profit.  

(00:18:24)    
**Speaker 0**:    Any community can find what are their initial set of boundaries, and also how we relate with each other and something very big in the TC has been the preventative culture. We want to prevent all of the bad things from happening by providing all of the values that make people feel good, that provide connection that bring community belonging. We don't need to go to extremes of the reactionary actions that we would need to take. Only when things go really bad. Then principle two is congruence between appropriation and provision. This is basically rules to keep the balance of the system going and keep the sustainability of it. How can we make sure that we're not gonna deplete all our resources? If we continue to use them freely what types of rules need to be there for us to continue to be abundant? And then number three, collective choice arrangements.  

(00:19:37)    
**Speaker 0**:    It talks about how the people who are in local circumstances should be able to change their local circumstances. If you're involved somewhere, you should be able to change the rules of that system. This comes really from, this is one of the most important aspects, especially when talking about governance is, what do we need to do to allow people this agency and what is the structures we need to have for this agency to come naturally and come in a way that it's meaningful for the whole, and that it's not gonna damage the public good that's being shared within everyone. Then monitoring. Ostrom has a really cool way to look at monitoring because it's a positive monitoring structure. It almost looks like a reward. If you're given the chance to monitor everything that's happening around you're gonna have more access to information, which is such a powerful resource.  

(00:20:44)    
**Speaker 0**:    And you're, you're just one of, you're equal to everyone. It's not like an external authority is monitoring the work, being done by someone else that creates weird power dynamics and there's much of a dialogue happening. Then this kills a bit, that sense of, oh, I'm being like a fool that I'm complying and no one else is complying. This mutual monitoring puts everyone in this place of being seen as a positive, as a positive thing. Then graduated sanctions is a lot of what we've been working on with gravity. That is if we need to have, if we need to have some type of control over it goes along with number one and two. If our boundaries are crossed or if the rules to ensure that we are abundant are broken, or if people were feeling like not well in the space in some way, if conflicts arise, there are multiple ways of seeing conflict.  

(00:22:08)    
**Speaker 0**:    And also something really special that she brings is this frame of having forgiving rules and forgiving sanctions. If you have something where someone broke a rule, or someone did something that created a conflict, or that made people not feel good, they want to have the chance of forgiveness. Then how can we build structures that goes back into the talk that Laura I gave the other day of restorative justice, how can we involve the people that are part of conflict to be the ones who solve the conflict and empower everyone to have this ability to look at problems in a way of solving them and to have some scales of what actions can be taken, depending on the seriousness of the infliction that happens. With the preventive culture is much harder that we'll have very serious things happening, but it's possible that they happen.  

(00:23:19)    
**Speaker 0**:    And how can we have such a strong foundation to be able to support that? Some of the things that some of the sanctions that we can give now in terms of the boundaries if someone has a behavior that is totally not allowed aligned with the community, maybe they can be removed from the trusted seed. Maybe they can lose their holdings. Maybe they can lose governance power. There are a few measures that we can take that can be discussed for each type of scenario. It's really amazing to have all of you interested in this because everyone is bringing different perspectives to how we can look into conflicts and people have people belong in different areas of the ecosystem. That also brings a lot of information that helps us take a fair stance over everything.  

(00:24:21)    
**Speaker 0**:    While I spoke about graduated sanctions and conflict resolution mechanisms, so one thing she talks about conflict resolution is that they should be available for everyone at a low cost. This is something we've been working on since the beginning of the cultural building, the TC, and one came to help so much with that. Also having those trainings and just the spaces for us to talk about this for free and opening space for education around this topic is part of this approach of having conflict resolution mechanisms available and at low cost, and then minimal recognition of rights to organize talks about if you're creating your own rules and boundaries and collective choice arrangements, and you have this whole structure, you would, it would be awful. If someone with more power can just shut all of this down. It's just speaking mostly about like if we are doing this, could the government of a country just stop us.  

(00:25:32)    
**Speaker 0**:   , what are the minimum recognition rights we need to organize legitimately in the way we are organizing. For this, we have the trusted seed and that's our legal strategy, having a legal association to protect at least the initialization of the TC. Then nested enterprises are just for comments that are nested within larger comments. We are all nested within larger commons. We are all nested within planet earth. That is the biggest commons we share. Just having this awareness of how many systems are within systems and which ones do we belong to, especially when designing a new system is very important. What are all of the other enterprises that we are inserted in, for example, the TC is within the XDI community and the Ethereum community and the DAO eco ecosystem and creating relationships be between all of those groups is super important. We're, we're also working a lot on this do to doubt relationships.  

(00:26:47)    
**Speaker 0**:    I hope this was understandable. I ran a bit because I wanted to have space to go to this exercise and feel free to send me questions over to chat or PME at any time. I wanna move to this phrase that I've been talking a lot about it everywhere, but it really, for a long time, but it really resonates with me because it clicked so many things and myself from understanding this. I had the pleasure to be in a meeting with Dominic barter. I was picking about the other day. He's a big guy in restorative justice and NVC nonviolent communication. Once I was the first NVC meeting I ever went, he said, this that stuck with me. That is the source of violence is the choices you didn't know you could make. In those choices, they can be very personal and they can be very systemic.  

(00:27:59)    
**Speaker 0**:    When we understand the systems that we are in and coming back to the prisoners' dilemma feeling like we can't exit the systems and feeling like so many choices were just like forced upon us, this creates a sense of violence. What I want to propose to us is that we can open paths to the self inflicting violence we have upon us, the self conflicts that are the root of collective conflicts. If we understand on a very personal level, what are the questions that we didn't ask ourselves? What are the choices we didn't know, we could make that we could have and how they've been violent with our presence. Once we start to find our expression as like adults and human beings in the world, a lot of these things, they start to be reciprocated and they might explode in different ways.  

(00:29:12)    
**Speaker 0**:    And we don't even know where they're coming from. Who asked me if I wanted to be in a capitalist system who asked me if I wanted to be a woman who asked me if I wanted to be, I don't know there's so many like educated in a certain system. There are so many things that we didn't know that we could choose. In fact, as we were like being born, we couldn't choose, but then how to reclaim ownership of this thing. I want to propose an exercise that is to identify some of this stuff. There are two questions that have been very powerful for me. One of them is what ways people treat you that you really don't like? And are there uncomfortable states? You feel often because the way you were or are treated, I want us to take some time to do this. I would love if either you can have, if you have a paper around you, or if you want to do like to open a doc and write it down, or the notes on your computer will take five minutes.  

(00:30:37)    
**Speaker 0**:    Why a so short time, because they should be intuitive. Deep down, what are the things that make you feel uncomfortable? And what are the ways that people treat you that you don't like? You won't have to share this with no one, unless you want it. Take this time to be very with yourself and to check in, to ask how you're feeling right now. Sometimes things come to our mind that it feels, oh, I don't think this. We tend to judge this thoughts or this image is, but feel free to write them down and to be vulnerable with yourself, because this is just for you. I'll give five minutes and also I can share my own exercise. If someone has a question of how to move, we have two minutes still, but I'm just gonna share the ones I did in case this can help anyone. I was reflecting on this on the weekend, and for me, things that are uncomfortable and the way I'm treated is to not be a priority in my intimate relationships, to not feel heard, to be treated with seriousness instead of joy, and to feel abused. This remind and will go more in depth into it. The, in the next exercise, 

(00:35:27)    
**Speaker 2**:    I can also share mine.  

(00:35:30)    
**Speaker 0**:    And you, one, sorry. It's, we'll open space for sharing later. Okay. I'm sorry. I just wanted to give one example, but we'll move forward with another part of the exercise. Does anybody needs more time? I'll take the silence as a good sign and they can move to the second part of this question that is starting a self dialogue. From the answers that you gave to yourself, how can you start talking with those statements?, what are they trying to tell you? And the hidden lines like we did with the statements from the three models, what is there that maybe you haven't looked at it before. Try to build questions for you to answer.  

(00:37:00)    
**Speaker 0**:    And then whenever you build those questions, you can add, if you want a scale of one to 10 of how much does affect you, this is only if like numbers help you to map yourself, but you don't need to do this one. I'll continue the example from mine. Then from here, we're gonna break up into some rooms for a bit. Whoever wants to share can share some of their processes. From not being a priority in my relationships, the question I ask myself is how can I prioritize my feelings, desires, needs, and wellbeing from not being heard? How can I open self dialogues to identify my needs and express myself better? How am I not hearing myself from being treated with seriousness instead of joy? Am I taking myself too seriously? What am I afraid, guilt or ashamed of?  

(00:38:22)    
**Speaker 0**:    And from feeling abused, what is blocking me from creating healthier boundaries? This can be like some of the questions that you can start opening for yourself, but it will look different for everyone. We'll have two more minutes before we go into the rooms. I hope everyone is doing all right there. So we're gonna go into breakout rooms. You can stay here exactly where you are, don't move, and I will move you to the groups. There what's gonna happen. Is that well realizing some of these things sometimes become way easier when we have a space to share and to open dialogue. It's totally fine. If you just want to be in listening mode, you don't want to open your camera if you want, you can be totally quiet. If you want to share anything that you found out about some of the, some of the choices that have been, that you feel like have been taken away from you, and what ways people treat you that you don't, and what are uncomfortable states, you feel often. This is starting to recognize patterns. Whenever we talk about them, it's usually very relieving. I want to give this opportunity for us to chat a bit about this, and we'll have about like five minutes, five to six minutes, and it can be like a minute or two sharing for each. If you feel, so I'll start moving you right now. If there's anyone that don't wanna be put in any group, just please let me know.  

(00:43:11)    
**Speaker 0**:    Hey Juan, do you think you can help me to move people to the groups?  

(00:43:18)    
**Speaker 2**:    Yeah, I was looking and I can actually drag people. Yeah, that's amazing.  

(00:43:25)    
**Speaker 0**:    And anyone feel free to jump into the groups you want as well.  

(00:44:14)    
**Speaker 3**:    Cool. This is the first time I've seen someone use discord for breakout rooms.  

(00:44:23)    
**Speaker 4**:    Yeah, that's true. Me too. Hi. I want  

(00:44:30)    
**Speaker 3**:    Does wanna share, does anyone remember how much time we were supposed to have per person?  

(00:44:42)    
**Speaker 4**:    No, I don't remember.  

(00:44:44)    
**Speaker 3**:    I can do the timing. I can start us with two minutes each as a guess. I'm not sure what she said. Who would like to go first?  

(00:45:07)    
**Speaker 4**:     

(00:45:10)    
**Speaker 1**:    Hmm.  

(00:45:12)    
**Speaker 3**:    Just checking.  

(00:45:14)    
**Speaker 1**:    No first.  

(00:45:15)    
**Speaker 4**:     

(00:45:17)    
**Speaker 3**:    You wanna go first, Michael?  

(00:45:20)    
**Speaker 4**:    Yeah, I can go first. Okay.  

(00:45:24)    
**Speaker 4**:    Yeah, I was thinking what I really don't like. One thing I don't like is that, if I'm expressing concerns about something or uncertainty about a problem that someone might have overlooked, for example, at work and people like go over it and don't care much about it. Yeah. In this situation, then I feel that I'm not valued that much or I feel misunderstood. Yeah, I'm not sure if like we want to collect and then go deeper. Or if I should also talk about the questions I came up with.  

(00:46:08)    
**Speaker 3**:    I'd say take about a full two minutes. We'll see what comes out and who we get through.  

(00:46:17)    
**Speaker 4**:    I should, no, I didn't get it. Should I go deeper now? Or what do you mean?  

(00:46:22)    
**Speaker 3**:    What do you guys let's go ahead. You spent about a minute for the first part, so I'll give you another minute for the second part.  

(00:46:29)    
**Speaker 4**:    Okay. Okay. Yeah, so I was asking myself, why do I want them to listen? Or, why I feel misunderstood or not valued. Maybe I'm thinking that my value depends on what others think about me. So this is I something I know which I want to get rid of, but yeah, this might be the cause I'm not responsible for solving problems for others if they don't care or yeah.  

(00:47:10)    
**Speaker 3**:    Thank you for sharing and thank you for going first. That was very brave. Jean. You're the only other one on camera. Do you wanna go next? Sure. Okay. I'll time you for two minutes. Yes, 

(00:47:22)    
**Speaker 5**:    Ma'am okay. Well, it's a bit similar in the issue that it's based on what other people think primarily, but how I've perceived that other people think is, how do you ever know really? But I have a inferiority complex. That's pretty severe. I term it as like imposter syndrome. Essentially I respect people of intelligence that I have privileged to be around significantly. When they are at their best and being intelligent and deserving my respect, I feel that I am like not a part fit. When they confirm that and treat me like I'm not relevant or not a part, but that's something that upsets me in a way and not angry, but just makes me feel like I need to be on the outside looking in versus participating in internally. Yeah, I came up with the same question though, is that my own perception of other people or is that my turning my own internal worries into reality by reflecting that onto them. I dunno, this is the discussion that I like to have. This is by the diligent people. I dunno the answers. I'd appreciate any feedback.  

(00:49:02)    
**Speaker 3**:    I hear that open for feedback. I'd like to give a minute to anyone who would like to give gene feedback. I will give you feedback. Jean. It's funny. I'm used to being asked for feedback in the sessions I do with people, but for this one, I was, scooting it away every time it came up, cuz I didn't expect it, but I just wanna tell you that you're worthy and you are that intelligent person in the room. When you don't bring yourself into the room, then like everybody's missing out on what you have to offer.  

(00:49:43)    
**Speaker 5**:    That's definitely kinda, really appreciate that. That's really  

(00:49:47)    
**Speaker 4**:    Nice. What I also would like to add is that, people tend to think people are intelligent because of the things they like achieved or, because they have a title or something, but yeah, this is not really like what counts it's like you can really, yeah. I would not like I was at university and I met a lot of people that were really worried about other thinking about how intelligent they are. Okay. To make it, make the point. You cannot really judge someone without knowing him deeply. Yeah. That's what I wanted to  

(00:50:34)    
**Speaker 3**:    Add. I'll add that you shouldn't judge yourself. Yeah. You're, Iking them from judgment and putting it on yourself so you can, yeah. Find that I'll go next. Unless sky REI or Receptus wants to go.  

(00:50:56)    
**Speaker 6**:    You can go, 

(00:50:58)    
**Speaker 3**:    Okay, I'll give myself two minutes. I didn't do the exercise because I didn't wanna cry. I'll do Libby, but I'll do it now. What are the ways people treat you that you really don't like? I don't like to be put on a pedestal or like for people to have  

(00:51:22)    
**Speaker 3**:    Very like high expectations of me. Then when I fall off that pedestal, then I get like blamed or accused of things I'm a very, I'm mildly autistic or I'm autistic. I also like to just like state what I see and I've learned social nuance to deliver that. Sometimes I just want to be straightforward and be, this person hasn't been around for three months, maybe they shouldn't be in this leader position that is guiding our consensus. Then people are, we don't think you should decide. I'm, I have this in the proposals channel because I want to see how, what people think about it. People just will make assumptions that I'm power grabbing people will make assumptions about me that I'm an individualistic narcissistic prick. I'm like such a collective oneness oriented Jew that, it just makes me sad.  

(00:52:20)    
**Speaker 3**:    It makes me sad that people are trained to see me as something I'm not. When Michael was talking, I was re relating to the misunderstanding that's like a deep wounding for me is being misunderstood and I'll, and I'll make myself small and I'll, and I'll leave channels and I won't make myself public, but what, the ways that I have, I do have a lot of self dialogue. I learned a lot about empowerment and self dialogue from 12 steps specifically, ACA, which is a behavioral version of 12 step. Not so much related to substances. I, my timing is almost up, but yeah, just building relationship with myself and building my relationship with others who are relating to themself and learning from each other, how to empower, cuz we weren't taught that most of us. I'll end with saying healthy. Reparenting okay. Zeus, I'm gonna pass it to you.  

(00:53:22)    
**Speaker 6**:    Oh no. Thank you for all your, those guys. I'm not, for me, it's so hard to express myself like what I do normally I don't, for example, I align with what you was said that writer and me, those are two situations. Like when, even when I don't, when I talk about the problem and I don't feel heard that hurts me and, but I usually just run away. Right. Okay. I feel like that my skepticism like there's something, I just don't, I just like I do understand. I just, I don't know. I just feel like running away and go on my comfort zone and that's probably not helping me to reach sometimes some goals, but yeah. I don't know. That's where I normally do, but yeah. Then also, it's a good thing. If like if you're running where you are not feeling comfortable, then you end up in a place where you feel comfortable. Right. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe sometimes it's preventing you to do some stuff at the other time. It's helping you to find like the, where you wanna be. I don't know. That's my worries.  

(00:54:46)    
**Speaker 0**:    Thanks for sharing Jeff. I just came to pick you guys up to go back.  

(00:54:54)    
**Speaker 3**:    Thank you. Thank you guys.  

(00:54:57)    
**Speaker 6**:    Thanks guys.  

(00:54:58)    
**Speaker 3**:    This is really special.  

(00:55:11)    
**Speaker 0**:    Just one to closing words.  

(00:55:28)    
**Speaker 0**:    I'm really, I'm really thankful that you all went through this exercise. It's a powerful one. For me. It has been with me for a while. Well, the place I wanted to arrive is that we can take ownership back. We can make new choices when we identify the choices that others took without our permission that have been bothering us or the systemic choices that we don't feel like we belong to. When we bring to the personal level, there are this little choices that we can identify and make new ones. There w there is this very wise women that I had the luck to meet in Egypt. She asked me that question, what do you hate the most that people do to you?, how do you hate that people treat you. I said, very quickly, I hate when people ignore me.  

(00:56:32)    
**Speaker 0**:    And she said, when are you gonna stop ignoring yourself? And that was very powerful. It has been resonating with me since, and I'm honored. I could share that with you. This path to empowerment and to taking ownership and to having agency is a substantial path for participating in self-governing communities. Because self knowledge is what can brings us this feeling of community, of autonomy, of interdependence and not codependence and not independence also, but understanding that we're all connected and that if we share the same values, what I want is the same that you want, and we don't have to fight for it. Informing ourselves of our processes also helps us to guide others through healing processes and through conflict management places. Self knowledge is the path to agency, cooperation, confidence, ability to support yourself and others and the way to find your true motivations, all very important aspects to governing our comments. Thank you so much for your time today and feel free to continue these conversations with me anytime, or with anyone here. Maybe you can reach out to each other and I'm sure this would be very welcome for a lot of people to.
