It takes time and practice to grow in Nonviolent Communication. I recommend the Compassion Course, they have a forum, weekly posts, monthly calls and various support groups

### Nonviolent Communication (NVC)
* A Language
* Way of Thinking
* Communication Skills
* Means of Influence
* Practice

Supports in connecting with ourselves and others in a way that promotes compassionate giving.

So that whatever we do is done willingly, not done out of guilt, or shame, or fear of punishment, or trying to buy love by submitting to the  expectations of  others

### Origin

**Marshall Rosenberg Asked the Question:**
What happens to people so they enjoy contributing to other people's suffering?

What happens to people so they relate compassionately and enjoy contributing to the wellbeing of others??

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Rosenberg
https://www.cnvc.org/fr/about/celebrate-marshall 

Dr. Rosenberg sought to learn what contributes to violence, and do whatever he could to transform it, to prevent it.

He learned what helps people remain connected to our compassionate nature, how to live that way, and distributed what he learned to others.

He Found that the skills necessary to live compassionately are quite different than the skills that we’ve been taught; Determined that violence is created by a way of thinking, language, and use of power, where some claim to be superior and know what's right for others

### Domination Structures

Domination structures teach people a language to remain disconnected from their power, so we’re forever looking to authorities to see whether we're right or wrong, and whether we're being judged as good or bad
 
To maintain domination structures people are educated with a static language that judges what they are, that identifies them as a certain type of person based on their behavior, their appearance, their intelligence.
This teaching is profound, helps me to see no matter how I tried to be free, I’ve still been caught up in whether I’m judged as right or wrong by authorities rather than connected with how my behavior was serving life

### Retributive Justice

Retributive justice judges people as right or wrong, good or bad - if you are judged as good, right, or appropriate you deserve to be rewarded - if you are judged as bad, wrong, or inappropriate then you deserve to suffer.

Marshall Rosenberg believed that thinking in a binary way, in terms of good/bad, right/wrong, normal/abnormal, appropriate/inappropriate, mentally fit/mentally ill, combined with retributive justice based on punishment and reward, is at the heart of violence on our planet.

### [Myth of Redemptive Violence](https://www2.goshen.edu/~joannab/women/wink99.pdf)

Walter Wink noticed a pattern in the structure of stories where a hero suffers under a bad guy, and must defeat the bad guy to restore order. 

They never reconcile or figure out creative ways to solve their problems, but forever repeat this same pattern.

### What’s happening to our needs

Rather than judging right and wrong, to decide whether people are punished or rewarded

Nonviolent Communication focuses on what’s happening to our needs
 
If our needs are met, then let’s celebrate! 

If our needs aren’t met, in a given situation, let’s take actions to fulfill those needs.

This is a radical departure from the language of domination that judges what people are. 
 
It's amazing how long standing conflicts can be resolved fairly easily, when we get past the enemy images, and get people to see the humaneness of both sides.

### Process

#### OFNR

**Observations • Feelings • Needs • Requests** 
 
Nonviolent communication suggest we make clear observations that tell people when their actions are meeting our needs, and when their actions are not meeting our needs.

#### Observation

**Statements of fact without judgement or evaluation**

#### Feelings

**Indicate whether needs are met**

https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/feelings-inventory

Feelings, in Nonviolent Communication, make no reference to what we think (analysis), but refer to our human emotions

Identify the feeling stimulated within you or guess what the other person is feeling

Naming the feeling without blame. Others don’t *make* us feel as we do.

### (We all share the same universal) Needs

I like the way these needs are broken into categories: https://www.mediateyourlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Needs.pdf

![](https://i.imgur.com/FQaYUli.png) 
 
https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/needs-inventory

When our needs are met, we enjoy pleasant feelings

When our needs aren’t met, we experience unpleasant feelings
Which need is likely to have been the source of that feeling?

### Requests

Clear action to fulfill needs, now

Without sounding like a demand, a clear request of some doable action.

After a clear expression of our experience, including an observation, feelings stimulated, our needs, if our need is not met, then Nonviolent Communication suggests we offer a clear and actionable request

Ask clearly and specifically for something to meet the need identified, rather than hinting or stating only what you don't want.

### Don't get addicted to your Strategies

If we are addicted to our strategies, it’s easy for others to experience our request as a demand, which threatens their need for autonomy, and makes it harder for them to enjoy giving.
The purpose of our request is never to get what we want, but to create a connection in which everybody's are met through compassionate giving.

### Give (only from a desire to serve life)

Nonviolent communication suggests we always give our energy, willingly, from a desire to serve life, not from a sense of duty, sacrifice, or obligation.

**Summary**
> The process of Nonviolent Communication involves sharing what’s going on with our feelings and needs: what would enrich our life, and receiving the same from others

### Further guidance and philosophy

### Responsibility for our emotion

Nonviolent communication suggests that other people may be the stimulus for our emotion but never the cause. 

Other people can’t make us feel anything, but we can create a lot of negative emotion when we get the idea of what others should do, and create a lot of unacknowledged demands
 
### Responsibility for our actions.

If we take responsibility for other people’s feelings, then our giving doesn’t contain the pure joy necessary for strengthening relationships, according to NVC

In nonviolent communication it’s important to never give someone else responsibility for our emotions, that we can only be responsible for our actions and the way we think.

There’s a little confusion for me here because on one side we say feelings indicate the state of our needs, but on another hand they can also be distorted by the way we think.

### Avoid Criticism or Demands

Whenever we hear criticism or demands it becomes difficult to enjoy contributing to each other’s well being

We want to communicate so that people know we never want our requests fulfilled out of guilt, shame, or fear of punishment

Whenever we influence people with shame, guilt, or fear of punishment, we are experienced as a source of violence, prepared to make them suffer if they don't comply

### Fear of what others think or say
Marshall Rosenberg taught that we only need to focus on our response, not giving our power to others based on fear of their judgement or criticism.

If you are hiding parts of yourself for fear of what others might say or think, take that message you are afraid of and wonder what needs might be behind such a message. 

### How to take peoples messages
1. take it personally and feel shame
2. judge them and feel angry
3. empathically connect with them
 
### Remain conscious of your Power to choose

Amtssprache is loosely translated into English as “office talk” or “bureaucratese.” It is a dangerous language that denies choice. 

At his trial for war crimes in Jerusalem, Adolf Eichmann was asked if it was difficult to send thousands of people to their death?

He answered "our language made it easy" It's a language in which you deny responsibility for your actions. If you don't feel responsible for your actions, you don't feel so bad when you do things like send people to their death. 

If somebody asked you why you do it, you say I had to, I had no choice. if people question that and say, Well, what do you mean you had no choice then you say, superiors orders, company policy. It's the law.

Words like have to, should, ought, must, and can't, are dangerous because they help people avoid taking responsibility for their actions.

Whatever structures we're in, never give the structure, or its rules, the power to determine what we do, so our actions come from choosing to act in harmony with our values.

### Anger, Depression, Guilt, Shame

Reminders that we're thinking in a way that contributes to violence on the planet

Let’s transform that thinking!

Thanks for the reminder, I’m out of touch with my needs! 

 
### Anger 
tells us that a need of ours isn't getting met, but our thinking is centered around judging the person who was a stimulus for our anger.
 
language implying wrongness, criticism, insult, diagnosis of pathology of others are the cause of anger.

Ask what need of mine isn’t met that’s being expressed as judgment of the other person?

### Depression (is caused by our way of thinking)

We live in a different world when connected to the need that isn't getting met, rather than stuck in the static language of what's wrong with us, that are we selfish, stupid, inconsiderate.

All of the thinking that makes us angry, depressed, guilt or shame is an expression of an unmet need. 

To learn our mistakes without losing self respect we need to connect to the need that wasn't met by our behavior.

Nonviolent communication uses the word feeling to refer to an emotion that someone is experiencing, without any diagnosis or intellectual analysis of them

### Saying No
A poor expression of unmet needs

To say no in a nonviolent communication way, we emphatically connect with their needs, say the need that keeps us from saying yes, and end on a request that searches for a way to get everybody's needs met.

### Hearing No
Look for the need behind the no

### Empathy
Presence: focused on the now, on feelings \ needs, not on thoughts.

If someone is telling you about painful events from the past, focus on what is going on in them now
Are you feeling… Because you’re needing?
 
When people need empathy the most, they're often expressing it in a pretty violent way. How to get in touch with this energy and flow with it?

It involves our full presence with what’s alive in them, at that moment.

http://cultureofempathy.com/References/Experts/Marshall-Rosenberg-Quotes.htm

#### Empathy before sympathy
When we are giving a sympathetic response, we're talking about ourselves. This takes the focus away from what’s going on in the other person.

#### Connection before correction
When people are upset, even if they're being upset is stimulated by a misinterpretation on their part, it really helps if we can empathically connect, before correction.

### Authority

#### Respect for authority 
when we have knowledge or experience that others do not, and they can see these things are valuable and as being offered to them, not imposed upon them

#### Fear of Authority

Usually built into the structure of the family, school, business, government. 

This structure gives us the right to impose things on people. We can reward or punish, to get people to do what we want.

Willing cooperation can be received only when people feel free from this kind of coercion, and they trust that their needs are valued.

When we're in positions of authority, we want people to do things because they see how it will enrich their lives and the lives of others

### Social Change

Gangs that I'm worried about, some of them call themselves governments, some call themselves corporations – organizations of people that have a big impact over our lives, and are doing things that contribute to great violence great suffering on the planet.

We can go upstream and to connect with the people who are supporting the structures that do the violence, and use Nonviolent Communication to offer alternative strategies than those which are oppressing people.

To bring about social change nonviolently, we want the change to occur because a critical mass of people willingly shift what they're doing, from one position to another.

### Restorative Justice

There's the person affected by a crime.

The person who acted in a way creating pain for others.

The third party involved in restorative justice is the community that provided the education that contributed to the person's crime.

We want to restore the situation by replacing the education that led to this behavior with an education that supports their contributing to people's well being, rather than doing things that create suffering for them.

### Gratitude in NVC
**Observation**: What actions enriched our life?
**Needs**: What needs were served by that action?
**Feelings**: Stimulated by our needs being met.

There is nothing more fulfilling for people than when they exercise their power to enrich life and then receive confirmation that they have. 

This allows them to experience how their efforts have benefited others.
