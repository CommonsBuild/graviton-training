### WORKSHOP

1. Introduction to the session.
2. Group splits into two for 30 minutes, with Nate and Anna-Marie facilitating a group each. We’ll ask each group to think about an organisation that they’re a part of and then workshop the following:

The first group explores how to create spirals into and out of positions of greater responsibility.We’ll give them the following ideas as a starting point: rituals of honouring and appreciation, time-bound roles (six months, or one year), advisor roles (or an advisor circle) that people can step into, supported hiatus (or offboarding) periods and clear processes on how to do that, knowledge sharing tools that pass over key information to those that step into new roles so those leaving know they can safely pass their role on, etc.

The second group explores how to design and embed ecosystem systems and structures that offer various pathways for inclusion, participation, and autonomy.We’ll give them the following ideas as a starting point: Groups of various sizes, clear internal information pathways, time-bound roles, maximum group sizes, setting up pods or crews (small groups of not more than 7 that meet regularly with a particular focus), facilitated spaces for difficult community conversations about power, hierarchies, social capital, gender, and inclusion, spaces in calls for reflection and contemplation, etc.

1. We’ll come back together so the two groups can share their discoveries and there’s some time for questions at the end.
