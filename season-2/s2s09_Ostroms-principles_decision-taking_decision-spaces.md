# Session 9 - Ostrom’s principles - Decision taking and decision spaces - Livia Deschenmeyer

Ostrom on another perspective - how can we express our full selfs and bring them to the organizations we are part of, shifting work into passion. Decisions are a reflection of your psychological state. Agency in collaborative environments.

## Relational Insights to Govern the Commons 

- Presence Relational clues from models
- 8 principles 
- Individual exercise
- Breakouts 
- Return 

## I AM

## Three Influential Models 
Frequently used models to provide a foundation for recommending state or market solution to governing public goods. 

### The Tragedy of the Commons 

“What is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it, Everyone thinks chiefly of his own, hardly at all the common interest” Aristotle

“Hobbes parable of man in a state of nature is a prototype of the tragedy of the commons: Men seek their own good and end up fighting one another.

“Wealth that is free for all is valued by no one, because he who is foolhardy enough to wait for its proper time of use will only find that it has been taken by another” Gordon  
1- Individualism vs collaboration. Harmed sense of community and belonging  
2- lack of shared values   
3- lack of trust, security, fear of being ridiculed. Vulnerability is seen as weakness  —--- vs reciprocity 

### Prisoner's Dilemma 

“In a prisoner's dilemma game, each player has a dominant strategy in the sense that the player is always better off choosing this strategy, no matter what the other player chooses.”

“The paradox that individually rational strategies lead to collectively irrational outcomes seems to challenge a fundamental faith that rational human beings can achieve rational results.” 
Feeling like there are no choices to exit the system 
1- Cooperating beyond rational choices - ratio, quantitative. 
2- adding qualitative variables

### The Logic of collective action 

“One who cannot be excluded from obtaining the benefits of a collective good once the good is produced has little incentive to contribute voluntarily to the provision of that good” 

“Olson considers it an open question whether intermediate-size groups will or will not voluntarily provide collective benefits. His definition of it depends not on the number of actors involved but on how noticeable each person’s actions are.” 

1- well being as the incentive to contribute voluntarily
2 - transparency not only to monitor, but to be seen. 
3 - positive monitoring

## 8 Principles for Governing the Commons 

1. Clearly defined boundaries
2. Congruence between appropriation and provision
3. Collective choice arrangements
4. Monitoring 
5. Graduated sanctions
6. Conflict resolution mechanisms
7. Minimal recognition of rights to organize
8. Nested enterprises 

Creating alternatives about the problems above 
The relationship between rules, graduated sanctions and conflict resolution mechanisms 

#### The source of violence is the choices you didn’t know you could make - Dominic Barter 

#### Self-violence and self-conflict are the root of collective conflicts. 

1. Identify 

What ways people treat you that you really don't like? 
Are there uncomfortable states you feel often because the way you were/are treated? 

2. Question

Start a self dialogue. 
Build questions for you to answer
In a scale of 1-10 how much this affects you?   
Learning the path for self discovery will help on guiding others 

3. Take ownership back 

Make new choices 
To yourself, informed by yourself 
  
#### Learning the path for self discovery will help on guiding others 

#### Self knowledge is the path to agency, cooperation, confidence, ability to support yourself and others and the way to find your true motivations. All very important aspects to govern our commons. 

## Forgiving Rules

> “If individuals make honest mistakes or face personal problems that occasionally prevent them from following a rule do not have access to mechanisms that will allow them to make up for their lack of performance in an acceptable way, rules may come to be viewed as unfair, and conformance rates may decline.”

> “The way in which rules are enforced is forgiving of occasional lapses and errors and allows appropriators to avoid the high costs that can result from rigid application of uniform rules in a changing and uncertain environment”

## Monitoring 

> “When the rules in use conform to the design principles discussed in chapter 3 (enabling individuals to design rules that will keep monitoring costs low) and individuals adopt contingent strategies, individuals are also motivated to monitor each other to obtain the information they need to pursue this contingent strategy.” 

> “If individuals begin monitoring others and learn that others comply most of the time with a set of rules, they are more likely to be willing to adopt and/or continue contingent strategies.” 
Preventive rather than reactive. 
Transparent.
