## Transcription

### Conflict revolution.  

(00:01:38)    
Welcome to those of you who are pinging in just now, I'm Loie. I have been really interested in conflict resolution since I was a teenager, really. Back when I was about 19, I got involved with a restorative justice group in Seattle and actually was able to help found the first restorative justice organization in my city, where we took cases of young adults out of the criminal justice system and offered them to divert into this process. 

That's essentially more like a healing talking circle and that was super valuable experience for me and ever since I started studying and working with them in my community, I became known as a conflict resolution person and my community called upon me in some pretty intense ways to draft up accountability processes. 

I ended up traveling up and down the west coast for some of the conflicts that I was dealing with gathering case notes and connecting victims. Conflict resolution has always been really important to me. 

It comes from my family systems as well. As a child being a smoother over of things. I'm a mediator and yeah, this is just a super big part of my heart and my life and what I offer to the world. I feel like I'm just constantly learning about it and there's no way to really ever become an expert. 

### Acknowledgement - Many have come before us.

On that note, I'd like to just recognize that many people and communities have come before us in this work. It's easy when we come up with new nonprofit orgs and new DAOs and new projects to think that we are coming up with new concepts, but in a lot of ways, we are rediscovering concepts that humans who lived more in community in the past, we're really wise with ahead of us. 

Lots of indigenous cultures practiced restorative justice of some sort or another. So I just wanna acknowledge that when we speak about restorative justice or any of these like new age models of conflict resolution, to know that we're not necessarily inventing this and we're actually borrowing from some really wise cultures

### Navajo Peacemaking

> “The Peacemaker Court is "a court-annexed system of popular justice, whereby respected community leaders organize and preside over the traditional Navajo trial, 'ahwiniti (where they talk about you), in the community in which the dispute arises". The idea is based on the traditional Navajo institution of hozhooji naal 'aanii, or peacemaking. In Navajo tradition, "a person who claims to be injured or wronged by another [would] make a demand upon the perpetrator to put things right". The demand was referred to as nalyeeh, which means compensation as well as a request to make the relationship right. If the person was unable to approach the wrongdoer himself or herself, it was common for a relative to do so. If these informal methods failed, the victim or victim's relative would approach a respected community leader, referred to as a naat 'aanii or peacemaker, to assist with the problem.“

(00:05:03)    
Here's an example in the United States, the Navajo tribe also known Asay have a traditional form of conflict resolution called peacemaking. I'll just read a little portion of this quote, not the whole thing, but in Navajo tradition, a person who claims to be injured or wronged by another would make a demand upon the perpetrator to put things right, going directly to them. 

The demand was referred to as ma which means compensation as well as a request to make the relationship right. If the person was unable to approach the wrongdoer himself or herself, it was common for a relative to do so if these informal methods failed the victim or victim's relative would approach a respected community leader referred to as nota, or a peacemaker that assist with the problem. 

Just honoring that in many ways, these traditions come from far before our time. I have a lot of gratitude to the people who practice this and sharpen these tools before the industrial revolution allowed us to forget indigenous ways of life and then rediscover them and think that we're inventing something really sexy and new.  

### Accountability 

[Why do we need accountability?](https://forthepeople.earth/accountability/) - forthepeople.earth 

> “If we do not call out our own corruption and dishonesty, we cannot call out the corruption and dishonesty of the system in power.”
> 
> << Bring the decentralization within >>
> 
> A call out is a gift, not a punishment, because it allows the person who has made a mistake the opportunity to learn and improve their understanding and behavior.
> 
> << Celebrating failure = test in prod = crypto culture >>

(00:06:41)    
**Loie**:    There was a bit of pre-learning homework that I sent out, and I'm not sure who all in here read and absorbed those resources. I just wanted to touch on them briefly this one for the people, the accountability document. 

This is from a really interesting activist group in Seattle, Washington. They're a group of organizers, a lot of climate justice organizers, a lot of people of color and other exploited identities who are the organizers leading here and doing direct actions. 

It was super important to them to create an accountability document that they all agreed to in creating this organization. I'm just gonna read a couple of their oops. One of their points is if we do not call out our own corruption and dishonesty, we cannot call out the corruption and dishonesty of the system and power.  

To me, that means like we're in a revolutionary space. Like everyone in this room and graviton, we can all recognize we are in a revolutionary space. If we have any chance at revolving the systems outside of this, we have to do that within too. 

To me, this is about bringing that decentralization within our own organizations and committing to de growning centralized power, even in our smallest internal groups also wanted to read this one, a call out is a gift, not a punishment because it allows the person who has made a mistake, the opportunity to learn and improve their understanding of behavior. 

Call out culture is one of the things that they actually explicitly agree to support in forthepeople. That's really interesting cuz in a lot of our places, especially people who are inclined to be peacemakers, they don't want to make public callouts and they maybe want to go towards Callins, where it's you're just addressing someone on a private level.

This group actually really recognizes that call out culture is an important part of their conflict resolution process. It's a tool that they agree is appropriate to use. 

(00:09:58)    
**Loie**:    To me, these call outs, when you do them in the open or when you have your conflict resolution process in the open, that means you can celebrate the learning. You can really, everyone can gain the learning from it and celebrating failure is test and that is crypto culture. 

If we take this experimentation of open source spirit that we all have where we're just gonna forge ahead. We know we're gonna mess up and it's gonna be visible when we mess up. 

This is the values, even in like in how code is written and deployed and recalled in open source and specifically in the crypto space, it's all out there for everyone to see. It creates this culture of celebrating failure, which we all learn a lot more from. 

### Dominic Barter

This next one is a video. It's an interview from Dominic barter who some people say he like invented restorative justice or like coined the term restorative justice. He probably wouldn't say that about himself. He has also the perspective of being a lifelong learner and he calls himself a student of conflict, but he has made waves in this community through his experience, devising conflict re resolution models for the ellas that he's lived in Brazil. 

> “I’m looking to restore connection within and between people and as communities. And then I'm looking for all the ways in which that manifests, in new acts which symbolize connection, just as the old acts symbolize disconnection.” - [Dominic Barter - What is restored in Restorative Justice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRjt8iZfi-8&ab_channel=NonviolentCommunicationNVC )

(00:11:54)    
**Dominic**:    How is the restorative justice process for you? The thing that is restored is always connection within people, between people and as communities, because the thing that is most on-goingly damaged has been connection. 

Lots of other painful things may have happened or may happen as a consequence of that diminished or broken connection within people, between people in communities. 

As I, in my way of reading why this works as it does it's connection that has been diminished or broken first and therefore it is connection that we seek to restore first. 

Just as all the stuff that we don't like is a consequence of that diminished or broken connection within and between people and as communities. The good stuff that we're creating, the conditions for reemerging is a consequence of connection within people, between people and as communities. 

Since I, my reading is that everything that we find that we're able to track observe record register comes in part from this connection. I wanna start with connection. 

All kinds of people have questioned whether restore or restorative is the most accurate word to use, but I'm looking to restore connection within and between people and their communities.  

Then I'm looking for all the ways in which that manifests in new acts, which symbolize connection just as the old acts symbolize disconnection.

(00:14:12)    
**Loie**:    I love this last thing that he said, and I wanna, I want to call this out again. It says, I'm looking to restore connection within and between people and those communities. Then I'm looking for all the ways in which that manifests in new acts, which symbolize connection just as the old acts symbolize disconnection. 

I love this because, it's a bit of a rabbit hole for me, but I have this area that in decentralized spaces where before there was the top of any hierarchical pyramid or process, **wherever there was a person at the top, we need to replace them with a process and have a process at the top**. 

Process don't have personality. Usually at least not as much as a person does right off the bat. I'm super interested in how we allow our processes to have persona and to be friendly. It comes in through ritual elements and through a community, really a dedicated community upholding the process. 

We've seen it in the TEC with the praise. That's a great example to me, of a process that has personality. Like there's no person that is the praise person. Who's like dishing out all the praise or administrating the process or anything, but still the praise process itself has this total jovial persona.  

I commend you guys as a community for being able to find within a process. That Dominic Barter is really right when he says we can look at old acts, old ways of conflict resolution, whatever that symbolize disconnection. Then we look for the new ones that actually symbolize connection. 

Is there something in the persona of this process that we're using that makes it connective? 

### Check In

I love that some of these graviton sessions are much more like teaching a lesson or just a solid presentation. I want this one to be a workshop. Just with you guys, I want lots of participation from y'all and now that I've feel a bit to you, that's when this participatory period begins. I would love to start with a check-in and this is my selfish double use of the check-in. 

I wanna know what you've learned so far in graviton because I need to be caught up. Unfortunately, I have another meeting at this hour every week that I can't miss except for today. I haven't gotten to go to any of the other graviton sessions. 

Could you guys just say your name and what you've learned in gravity so far in the graviton training, maybe I will call on someone to start. Do I see Ashley in here?  

(00:18:10)    
**Ashley**:    Yes, it is. It's been a while since I've seen you. It's great to see you and I'm glad that you're here. I'm doing pretty good today. It's been a busy day and my brain has been in a lot of places, but it's nice to actually talk and check in. Yeah. What I've learned so far in gravity, the biggest thing that I've taken away from this is, and you touched on it in one of your slides.

These conflicts that are coming up in our communities are actually like gifts and ways that we can evolve and connect with one another more and get to probe these situations so that we can learn from them rather than just dissolving conflict right away actually using it as a tool to make our communities better. I don't know if better is the right word, but more cohesive  I will pass it to Tam.  

(00:19:23)    
**Tom**:    Hey, I'll also keep it quick. Hey, everyone, what I've learned is that there's so much interest in nonviolent communication and managing complex, and there's a lot of really passionate people in the TEC. It's amazing to see everyone here week after week, and I'll pass to Jean.  

(00:19:43)    
**Jean**:    Thank you. Ma'am yeah, I've learned specifically that rhetoric is obviously critical, but to reassess our perceptions of our own rhetoric regularly and try to understand its origins and what it implies about ourselves and our word choice and the way that we select what we're gonna say and how that conveys more about us than we perceive or believe regularly, I'll pass it to, I wishes.  

(00:20:27)    
**Aloysious**:    I wish just, I use them pronouns and my part's ING. I'm having an anxiety attack right now. It's not a bad thing. I'm autistic. I got really excited about what I was hearing, what I was hearing about the people and how there used to be people and the hierarchy and structures. Now there needs to be a process, just got my heart racing. Cause I feel like I pride myself at, to sleep at night knowing that's the thing that we need and them hearing that thing about it needs to be personal. 

I know the answer is documenting workflows and processes cuz like I know that's how I made organizations work in the government and I just don't see it happening here. It helps with continuity and all I want is collaboration and mentorship to be part of the process in DAOs spaces. Like that's the piece that I'm hearing and the fun and the documentation is mentorship and fun ways of documenting your processes instead of making them like boring and streamlined. That's my check in, I'm like all over the place, thinking about those topics. 

I am also a bit scattered today and very happy to be here. The nugget that really is sticking with me the most from the graviton training is conflict being a gift and conflict being yeah, a really good thing and a crucial part of community and really reorienting towards that way of looking at things. Yeah, that's all with me for now. I will pass it to Lauren.  

(00:22:39)    
**Lauren**:    Oh cool. Nice. What I learned in gravity? Well, I like everybody's check-ins are like really broad concept things. I was thinking of something very specific that I learned that I thought was really cool was this Maslow's hierarchy of needs thing and how like job dissatisfaction is associated with like your basic needs your safety needs not being met. Then job satisfaction is based on like your growth needs being able to be met. That's really interesting and cool. Like all the conflicts that come up are that I observe coming up are often like really simple things, like unclear work agreements or like compensation related and then, but yeah, it's like when everybody's feeling like support and uplifted forward, that's like where the satisfaction comes from. 

(00:23:46)    
**Morgan**:    My name is Morgan. I use their own pronouns. What I'm learning is just a, this is the first time that I've been in DAO space and I'm learning through relationships with you all and the collective invitation to lean into conflict as like a regenerative process. I'm so grateful for all of the creative frameworks that allow us to codevelop based off of that understanding. 

(00:24:41)    
**Forest**:    Hi there. This is Forst. I've definitely, I've been very passionate about communication and conflict resolution for a long time. This has really shown me how much interest and passion there is in bringing this to yeah. This industry decentralized spaces and also like larger organizations. It's really uplifting to see.  

(00:26:48)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I, what I learned from this is that you always continue learning and it's not like a skill that you got once and you have it for the rest of your life, but it's something like it's a living practice of every day being on top of the crazy horse that is in your mind and I'll pass to  

(00:27:21)    
**Speaker 6**:    Hi. Thank you. What I've learned. The fact that in those new, the kind in that in those new organizations, you can actually bring yourself as a person. Not only your skills or not only what you're capable of doing, but you can bring yourself and not only just the way it is, but also within a learning mindset, by going into the relationship with other people, by meeting other people, you learn and you open up that space, that is you, your identity, open it up to other people and you going to this process together and I love that. Just you just the way you are. Then in the learning mindset, I bringing that and being welcomed for that. I really, and I pass it on to, let's see a temp, 

(00:28:48)    
**Speaker 10**:    For me, the largest learnings iPad so far is the actual realization of why super conflict arise. Just the reasons why behind it. I like have chance to understand things that happened in the DAOs. I'm part of better from a why and abstracted from the actual person and really just UN taking a step back and understanding that again, conflict could be used to also drive change and really that for me, what came out most, and I hope it's not too loud in the background.  

(00:29:49)    
**Speaker 6**:    I can take it next. Well, first it was a really good surprise to see Dominic. I met him in Rio. It was the first nonviolent communication speech I went in my life. I was quite young and I never knew his name. Then you showed now, and then I could see it, oh, is this guy? And he said something that was so impactful to me, that was violence is born from the choices we didn't know we could make. That, it's such a simple and profound phrase that resonates so much with me very often and something, we've been learning a lot in gravity is how this is a meeting space for like us to see that we have much more in common that we could imagine. Also for being an entry point to the, that space, which is yeah, really beautiful. Also conflict transformation is just everything we need that I'm based in Brazil. Now it's almost every day that there are protests outside of the building and it is just, we're getting to a point where we really need solutions. I appreciate all of you being in this room right now and I'll pass to my  

(00:31:43)    
**Speaker 12**:    Great. Thanks. The thing that I've been learning is the methodologist and the different approaches and also specifically about rebuilding trust within dos. That is very nice as I see it as a constant and common thing within all the communities and also like obviously in any type of community, but within this digital space, it is really nice to have like some steps to guide, but not to follow us put on a stone, but to have us inspiration, then adapt them. Then us as this constant learning graviton be ready to adapt them. Thank you very much.  

(00:32:45)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Okay. Nick, have you gone?  

(00:32:51)    
**Nick**:    I have not. I, sorry. I was, I'm having a lot of troubles with my stream right now, but I was just gonna say that one of the there's been so many things that have been absorbing from this graviton course that I've really appreciated the presenters and the different perspectives from a few of the conversations we've had. I just the biggest thing I'm taking away is that there are organizations like this, that there are organizations of people that are attempting to build these kinds of accountability, processes and restoration processes together decentralized without one single person running the show. I just, I love that. I'm excited to learn more. I don't know who else to pass it to. I'm so sorry that I've been having such wifi trouble. If someone could help me next, 

(00:33:42)    
**Speaker 6**:    I'll jump in. I've gosh, so much has stuck with me. A big thing is the NVC. I joined the book club and also last week's talk. It's just really incredible having a huge paradigm about how we relate to each other. Then also how we interpret those relations. I've been mulling a lot over that and it really has been powerful, not just in the DAO space, but also in so many other aspects of life. I don't know who else to call on next.  

(00:34:27)    
**Loie**:    We've had it Thomas, a healthy, random checkins. Okay. Thomas. Cool. I'll say, if people don't wanna check in too. That's okay. After Thomas, I'll just ask if there's anyone else that's like feeling really called to say something. Go ahead, Thomas.  

(00:34:51)    
**Speaker 13**:    Right. Jab. That's what stuck with me from this rapid training is more like how we must train the ability to listen to people no matter if we are in opposite sides and conflict, but especially if you want to be mediating a space, both for DAOs space or formation spaces. That's ability that twin must try to improve and always emulate people to pray and adapt. I don't know who else is who else is from the checking? Yes, it suits. Thank you.  

(00:36:02)    
**Speaker 15**:    Yeah, no problem. Thank you. The thing that I've really learned from so far from gravity is that how much of a need conflict resolution it has within all communities and as individuals being prepared to mitigate conflict and not just be reactive towards conflict, but be to be anticipatory and learn how to look at conflict from different lenses, whether it be from non-violent communication or from a connecting framework or just having more empathy in terms of dealing with people within decentralized organizations is very valuable and something that we take for granted in our traditional systems. So being able to look at it and come together as a group and have this positive feedback loop on the knowledge that we're all sharing around this issue is really important. Something that I didn't realize until the till I saw how many people showed up to these graviton trainings. It's very exciting. I will pass it to I'll say next person ju up.  

(00:37:23)    
**Loie**:    And if, sure, how many people we have in here versus how many have gone, but yeah, I'll just give a minute now. Is there anyone else who would like to still, 

(00:37:39)    
**Speaker 4**:    Yeah, I can share my name is luck and I use say them pronouns. I wishes invited me into this training, and this is only the second week I've come. Definitely still like under getting to understand like what this space is, but I really liked, I watched one of the videos that was posted in the chat by the same person that you shared the video of. I love what they said about like wanting to create rooms for conflict creating literal spaces that are designated in the way that we have like a bedroom designated for rest. Cuz we anticipate that's a need. We're gonna have like creating rooms and processes and agreements around conflict because we know it's something that we're gonna encounter and not something to avoid. I thought that was a cool learning from today and it's yeah. Great to be here. Thank you.  

(00:38:42)    
**Speaker 4**:    Hi. I can jump in really quick. I just wanna say that I feel that what I've been learning most is that it's not just about how we feel like how I feel personally, but it's also about like how the other gets the impression, what I've been saying. It's like the community it's important. We wanna be heard, but we also need to listen and also be careful about like how we say it. Like we are learning that on the book that we are reading and I had other things to say too, but I feel contemplated for everyone that I read before me.  

(00:39:39)    
**Loie**:    Great. On that, for timing, I'm gonna move us past this check in, but we're gonna be like lots of other opportunity for you guys to speak out as well. Let me just go back to the consenting here. Okay.  

### Restorative Justice Theory
* Dispute resolution can be fully decentralized
* Restorative Justice in the Present Moment: why we ask about the NOW rather than the past

(00:40:08)    
**Loie**:    Thank you so much for catching me up on these things. I wanna just talk really briefly about the theory of restorative justice. It's a practice, a methodology that believes that dispute resolution can be fully decentralized. 

What that means is there is no external party that is the of anyone's fate. To me like for sure a judge is centralized. But even a mediator is a point of centralization. 

Someone that you are talking through rather than just talking to your the person you were in conflict with that is a point of centralization. 

In restorative justice, there are only facilitators. There are no judges, there are no mediators, there's no sentencing committee. There's no sentencing guidelines, sentences are called action plans and they are completely created by the folks closest to it. 

Also, the most important question that we use in a restorative justice circle is how are you now in relation to the conflict that happened? This is we stay in the present moment. 

That this really is underpinned by the book. That conflict is a gift mostly to our present and to our future. It's the opportunity to make things better in the future rather than dwelling on something in the past. Yeah, the justice, it dwells in the present moment in that way.  

(00:42:09)    
**Loie**:    I'm just gonna like rapid fire some questions at you guys. I'd love to hear your quick answers just to get a temperature check here. 

### Who knows the most about how a conflict should be resolved?

Who do you think in a group knows the most about how a conflict should be resolved in any organization or community which roles or which architects or which people in that community know the most about how a conflict should be resolved?  

(00:42:48)    
**Speaker 3**:    I wanna say the oldest people give the other least some credit.  

(00:42:53)    
**Loie**:    Okay. Okay. Any other, 

(00:42:56)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I would say also a mix between subject matter experts in the area of the conflict and also people specialized or trained in conflict management.  

#### The folks involved closely in it

**Loie**:    Okay. In restorative justice, we pretty much believe exclusively that the folks involved closely in this crime or this conflict know the most about how it should be resolved. In many cultures that use restorative justice, they also have like a higher respect for elders. 

Those folks usually have a seat at the table. They are considered a stakeholder in the conflict, but they're not really the ones who know how to the only people that know how to resolve a conflict are the people in the conflict. 

That's what we believe in restorative justice. 

### How are people most likely to follow an action plan/restitution/sentencing?

What about, how are people most likely to follow an action plan or a sentencing? Like in what way would you be able to form such a sentencing or a plan that you think would be the most success for people following it?  

(00:44:21)    
**Speaker 8**:    The people that are involved in the conflict then create the action plan and then can execute it because they're motivated because  

#### If they are a part of creating it

(00:44:31)    
**Loie**:    Ding. Exactly. This is a strong belief of restorative justice and probably some other conflict resolution models that you guys have studied during this training. What we have created. We feel a lot more accountability. If we've had a hand in it.

### Quick Question

(00:45:10)    
**Speaker 6**:    Can I ask a question?  

(00:45:13)    
**Loie**:    Sure.  

(00:45:15)    
**Speaker 6**:    There was something you said about the call out culture. How like what are the elements that need to be present for a call out culture to not become a canceling culture?  

(00:45:30)    
**Loie**:    That's a great question. A big one. Primarily the agreement around call out culture is really helpful to know that everybody has already, everybody who's participating in that community has already agreed that this is one of our methods that we will tap on. 

Strong relationships between one another and a real environment where your neighbor's success impacts your success. Right? This is where we are talking about aligning incentives. 

If you are if your colleague or fellow in your community, if their success is directly tied in with your own, then you won't have a motivation to just like blatantly call them out in a way to ally exclude them from the community. I don't know. Olivia, do you have any other answers to your own question?  

(00:46:52)    
**Speaker 6**:    Yeah, I, yeah. That I resonate with what you said of creating agreements mostly and having like a trust fabric that things will be resolved. Cuz maybe like canceling culture also comes from trauma of not wanting to be in the same space or to continue to be involved with someone that has caused someone else pain or things like that. Then if there is the trust that issue is being supported and that there will be a resolution that will feel good for all parts. Then yeah, 

(00:47:38)    
**Loie**:    That gave me two other ideas. Actually it just makes me think how like psychological, emotional care for all people really would help in that scenario. Right? Like to have a baseline in our society where like everyone is able to access and afford therapy, counseling, coaching, and maybe spiritual support as well. 

To have that as a baseline of your needs being taken care of allows you to phone call outs better in a way where you don't feel like you wanna run away out of the, and the other thing that brought up for me was just to give it in our rules that we would call it *roles, not souls*, but this general principle that you're never labeling a person when you are giving them negative feedback. 

It's never saying like you are this way. You are an offender, you're a problem causer, it's about focusing on the specific act or the specific pattern of acts that's happening and not assigning that as a persona of the person in front of you. 

That's something that restorative justice adheres to pretty strongly, it refuses to use the words victim. Generally we speak of stakeholders in a crime stakeholders, in a conflict and most, if we really need some distinction, we will say like a person who was harmed and a person who caused harm, cuz then we know that those people are really just people and their relation to the conflict, just certain actions they took. It's not an identity that they have.  

### Why is it important to resolve conflicts?

(00:49:43)    
Coming back to why is it a to resolve conflicts? That was an question by the way, for us in restorative justice, we will get it as a way to cure the illness that led to that conflict. Knowing that the conflict is really only a symptom. I know that you gravitons already get this because so many of you reflected that in your check in that you're like I already learned that this principle, that conflict and it's an opportunity to go and heal the conditions that led to such a conflict possible. I'd love to brainstorm with you guys. Now I know you're a few weeks in your training here and I'd love to get some ideas of different types of conflict resolution that you've heard of  

#### To cure the illness that led to the conflict (a symptom)

(00:50:52)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Nonviolent communication and shadow work.  

(00:50:59)    
**Loie**:    Hmm.  

(00:51:04)    
**Speaker 6**:    Deep democracy

(00:51:22)    
**Speaker 8**:    I used to do something at this intentional community. I was part of called talk and release where everyone you didn't, it wasn't totally resolving things. Everyone just expressed themselves. Then a lot of the times things got resolved as a result of that.  

(00:51:48)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Role play and therapy like secret.  

(00:52:06)    
**Speaker 6**:    Crewing.  

(00:52:20)    
**Speaker 6**:    Polarity mapping, 

(00:52:23)    
**Loie**:    Polarity mapping. Whoa. I'll go ahead and throw up here piece making goals and similar to restorative justice. What about normal criminal justice? Yeah, that's one  

(00:52:44)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Litigation and also our alternative dispute resolution  

(00:52:52)    
**Speaker 12**:    To say that and at the decentralized dispute free solution  

(00:53:00)    
**Loie**:    Stuff like decentralized dispute resolution.  

(00:53:12)    
**Loie**:    You guys are so full of ideas. I had a list over stimulate, but I should have known you wouldn't need it.

(00:53:23)    
**Speaker 12**:    Celeste.  

(00:53:45)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Spiral dynamics and law is a system to have public resolution. Law.  

(00:54:00)    
**Loie**:    What about like parents solving kids conflicts. There's no name for this really, but all of us have experienced it. If we have siblings  

(00:54:19)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Also like advice process or like peer to peer, sometimes we just need someone to talk to.  

(00:54:29)    
**Loie**:    Mm, great. This is an awesome list. Okay. Any other, is there a last flip point there while we've written for it for second  

(00:54:52)    
**Speaker 6**:    Negotiations?  

(00:55:01)    
**Loie**:    And that makes me think that mediation should be on there too. Right.  

(00:55:07)    
**Speaker 10**:    What about game theory or just, I know it's quite broad and most of these things in bulk game theory, but just basically incentive and or rewarded and punishment.  

(00:55:24)    
**Loie**:    Okay. Right. That's almost like an automated conflict resolution. Yeah. Of that as more of a conflict discouragement rather than a resolution, but it's definitely a tool. Okay, great. This such a big list. I'm so happy being with you guys.

#### Brainstorm: what types of conflict resolution can you think of?

Restorative Justice • NVC • Shadow work • Deep Democracy • Talk & Release • Role Play • Therapy • Crewing • Polarity Mapping • Peacemaking circles • Litigation/Punative justice system • Alt justice resolution • Decentralized Dispute Resolution • Celeste • Spiral Dynamics • Law • Parents solving sibling conflict • Peer-peer/someone to talk to • Negotiations • Mediation • Game theory: reward & punishment

**Breakout questions: What type of community/situation would this practice be best for? Is there a centralized party in this method?**

### Breakout rooms

I love conflict resolution so much and it's very rare that I get to be with this many conflict resolution nerds. 

(00:58:19)    
**Loie**:    Yes. The questions. Okay, cool. The questions here, just pick one of these, one of these conflict resolution methods that's listed up here and answer the questions. What type of community or what type of conflict would this practice be the best for? And is there a centralized party in this method? And I'm hoping you guys can bring back some short answers on those report, back to the big group. Are there any questions about how to actually get into these frames? Actually one, if you wanna just like explain to me and then anyone else who was infused about it. Well know from there.  

(00:59:12)    
**Juan Carlos**:    If you scroll, you can see that Dugas is right now in omega. Yeah, just like we should have around like four people joining him and maybe I will join on commons, voice channel, and yeah. Five people joining me and Alois issues maybe joins in soft go and five people. With you, if we are 20, like four groups of 5 people works.  

...

(01:00:36)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Okay. I will paste the screen of Lois activity in the gravity so that we can follow it.  

(01:00:57)    
**Speaker 16**:    Are we just picking one from this list and then talk about like which situation to be best for?  

(01:01:09)    
**Speaker 12**:    One quick question. Oh, sorry.  

(01:01:13)    
**Speaker 16**:    Oh, go ahead.  

(01:01:15)    
**Speaker 12**:    Thanks. One, a quick question. Is there anybody from met game that have already graduated from graviton from gravity?  

(01:01:30)    
**Juan Carlos**:    No, now we have a lot of people participating, but we have not like the first graduated graviton still.  

(01:01:40)    
**Speaker 12**:    Okay.  

(01:01:49)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Okay. What, which one will we choose? Mm  

(01:02:11)    
**Speaker 6**:    I'm just taking a look at the slide right now.  

(01:02:17)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I would say L litigation like traditional justice system. Do you think that would be a good choice traditional justice system? Or should we choose another one?  

(01:02:48)    
**Speaker 16**:    I'm okay with that if you guys are  

(01:02:54)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Okay.  

(01:02:55)    
**Speaker 12**:    That's it.  

(01:02:58)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I will take some notes. On which cases it's good to use litigation traditional justice system. I would say that when there is no good will from the parts to reach from a negotiated solution.  

(01:03:24)    
**Speaker 12**:    And also when there are clear ways to go out of to yeah. To solve the issue that are already like written down or that there is some type of Juris, prudence or history on how to solve them.  

(01:03:40)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Clear ways to solve the issue.  

(01:03:50)    
**Speaker 16**:    Did you say one if the individuals don't like aren't familiar with each other or did you say something along those lines?  

(01:04:02)    
**Juan Carlos**:    When there's no good will to reach a negotiated solution to yeah. Foster communication and clear ways to solve the issue yeah. Previous experience and I would, Hmm.  

(01:04:33)    
**Speaker 6**:    I almost think it's makes me think of the Caffin model. When things are clear you almost follow that best practices versus you might wanna use a different type of conflict resolution if the parameters are complex or chaotic  

(01:04:57)    
**Juan Carlos**:    And yeah. There is a centralized party in this method party. Maybe we can choose another one so that we do too, because we already said some things about this traditional litigation, justice systems.  

(01:05:27)    
**Speaker 6**:    Almost as if like a broader group of more creative or human based. Like some of the things that I see that might fit into that I'm familiar with are spiral dynamics, ORC or shadow work, where it's focused really on the human connection or relations to human needs.  

(01:05:56)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I also think that maybe when there's an, a need of authority, that would be a case of using this litigation mechanism too. How about if we discuss a bit for the negotiation and mediation? They work really well when they're Goodwill to negotiate. When there are common interest for a possible beneficial outcome for all parts, that negotiation, and there's no centralized party in negotiation.  

(01:07:20)    
**Speaker 16**:    Like if a non zero sum outcome is possible, that lends itself more to negotiation versus like an arbitration by a centralized party.  

(01:07:46)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Now the question that I was thinking is then, which are the ones that are fully decentralized.  

(01:08:04)    
**Speaker 16**:    I  

(01:08:05)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Don't know, because she said about our restorative justice, but actually that's not my strength.  

(01:08:17)    
**Speaker 12**:    What is the difference between restorative justice and decentralized speech resolution?  

(01:08:24)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Okay. Re restorative justice is what she was explaining where there is no like third part, but the system fosters the communication between the two people, but in the centralized dispute solution, we can have a third part facilitating the communication. Of the centralized dispute resolution, something as Claros or argon court that maybe somehow are similar to the litigation system, but they don't work with states.  

(01:09:19)    
**Speaker 12**:    The restoration will be more like a distributive way. There is no middle money.  

(01:09:27)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I, in my experience I haven't been so much near to restorative justice circles, but what I have seen is that they work really well in small communities where like everyone knows each other and the community can like promote the process without having someone like delegated to carry that flag.  

(01:10:02)    
**Speaker 12**:    It would be, for example, if we ha, if we all become gravitons and then we all participate in our community, so let's say that all these communities born by gravitons, then we could take the process forward. That would be more like a restorative, but in this way, also you will need like some roles as you were explaining anything on the first or second session for the, for a person not to gain enough power to be always there, something like that.  

(01:10:37)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Yeah. Maybe when we all are gravitons we can practice restorative justice because there shouldn't maybe in no need of a mediator between the conflictive parts, but that the conflictive parts can talk safely about their conflict within themselves and within the organization.  

(01:11:12)    
**Speaker 12**:    Okay. It sounds like evolution. We all need to get this knowledge and experience in order to carry this restorative approach.  

(01:11:26)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Yeah. I understand it works really well in small communities and a lot of indigenous communities actually here in Colombia, there's also indigenous communities that have this role that is called the word man, El Pareto. He is a person that, he like proposes to the parties a solution., but it's not like an imposition, but it's like what they consider to be fair. It's what the, it's well seen within the group  

(01:12:20)    
**Speaker 10**:    Guys. Sorry to interrupt. Just that. Laurie asked me to ask everyone to come back to gravity.  

(01:12:28)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Okay. Let's come back.  

### Why doesn't centralization work?
* Recidivism
* People do not experience healing in court
* Massive profit for private justice system companies

(01:12:34)    
**Loie**:    God is still joining us. Originally I thought we could report back on this, but for now I really wanna get to talking about practical implementation. Just briefly, why doesn't centralization work in justice or in conflict resolution? 

we can see that it doesn't work because of recidivism. Recidivism is a fancy word for people returning to the criminal justice system. After they've already been through it they go to court, they are sentenced to prison time. They go to prison, which is supposedly a correctional facility, which if it was doing any correcting, they probably would never come back there. 

We see massive rates of recidivism up to 80% in some demographics for certain crimes. We know it's not working. Also people don't experience healing in court. My restorative justice teacher, wonderful woman named Andrea Rennicke. She was a lawyer and her turning point was realizing that people came to her looking for peace and for healing. Instead she brought them to war. and that was her job as a lawyer bringing them into court. 

Another thing is there's too much opportunity for like really bad profit models, at least in the United States. There's a whole industry around like private justice system companies. It's not just jails that are privately run. 

It reaches into the social work sector. It re reaches into weapons manufacturers. Actually a lot of the companies that own private prisons also own like military weapons, manufacturing companies with big contracts, government, and also own and operate our like social work offices. 

We've we've outsourced that to private companies. Then they have an incentive to really not do what they came there to do, but actually to continue the cycles of poverty and exploited families.  

(01:15:32)    
**Speaker 18**:    Can I just mention one thing? Before centralization occurs, it seems to me that if we centralize our education system, what a community or culture educates is what it becomes. We educate people in this punitive and reward system. Then it's inevitable that we'll end up with centralization out of that and will inevitably end up with a punitive and reward justice system. Before all of this parts that you're talking about now it's profit for everybody. If what I'm saying, it keeps everybody absolutely at every layer all the way down the line.  

(01:16:14)    
**Loie**:    That puts an extra spin on the school to prison pipeline. Right. We even like a lot of us experience it in our families. This punitive justice systems and kids not feeling like they have agency over the decisions around conflict in their lives and that someone else needs to make a decision for them. It starts early. That's a great point. 

### Practical Implementation

I want to talk about practical implementation because it's really possible for all of y'all to have strong conflict resolution methods in your respective organizations and communities. I would like to give you something to take away and to take home with you from that session. I just so there's some steps for setting up a conflict resolution process in your community. 

### How to set up a conflict res process in your org

1. Selecting a method
2. Selecting Facilitators
3. Team agreement to use the method
4. Time resolving conflict is paid time
5. Company culture: Celebrate conflict!
6. Training for new Facilitators

#### Selecting a method

The first thing you need to do is select a methodology.  

There was like 20, 25 ideas that you guys all brainstorm there of different ones of there's even more out there on the wide web. As long as you have some governance process, some decision making process in your community, then you can propose one of those methods and have everyone agree to it. 

That's really important to agree to the methodology ahead of time. It can always be changed at a later date. It could be, "we're gonna try NVC for 2022. If we don't like it, in 2023, we'll choose a different one" but having that agreement is really helpful. 

#### Selecting Facilitators
The second thing is facilitators. You need to have clear facilitators that everyone knows who they are and thus how to initiate the conflict resolution process. You also need training for these facilitators. It should be pretty open and available for other folks in the community to become a facilitator of this method.  

#### Team agreement to use the method
Number three is getting the team agreement on using that method. You also want to hold up that time spent resolving conflict is valuable time. 

#### Time resolving conflict is paid time
If you are in a community that works together, or that has some financial engagement together, if people are paid for other things they do with their hours, they should definitely be paid for time that they spent resolving conflict. 

Whether that's a conflict that they started or that they're facilitating or what we gotta make people know that this is valued.  

#### Company culture: Celebrate conflict!
The last thing is just celebrating conflict, celebrating it as a learning process, celebrating failure, and having that be an organization wide culture and feeling that conflict is good. Great opportunity. 

I like breaking down the word responsibility. Cause you could say maybe in your org values that if there's a conflict, the participants have a responsibility to resolve it, but it's not so heavy. Right. If you look at it's an ability to respond. It's an opportunity. 

### Conflict Resolution in Practice

Then going in on a micro of what one of these conflict resolution processes would look like in practice. 

#### The Kwanlin Dun Community Justice Project is a community-based program in the Yukon that facilitates offenders and victims through the process of circle sentencing. The process involves seven steps: 

1. The offender is referred by police or peace makers for diversion or mediation. 
2. An application is made to the Kwanlin Dun Justice Project. The application involves many parties, including an elder, the victim coordinator, probation officer, community members, etc. 
3. The community justice committee makes a decision to accept or reject the application. The offender, victim, justice system and community may provide input to the committee. Cases that are rejected go to court. If a case is accepted, the committee makes a decision on when, where, and who to include in the circle sentencing process.
4. The offender support group and the victim support group prepare for the circle. This may involve meetings and possible mediation between representatives of the groups. 
5. The circle sentencing hearing takes place. 
6. The sentence is implemented. 
7. The community pardons the offender. 

This justice project, the Kwanlin Dun Community is on a Navajo reservation in Yukon territory. It facilitates offenders and victims through circle sentencing process. 

I'm just gonna read out to you guys, these seven steps. Cause they're really valuable to know step one, the offender is referred by police or peacemakers for diversion remediation. 

In whatever methodology you use in your org, you just wanna know who are these referral people who has that role? Cuz you probably don't have police in your community. 

Who are the peacemakers or who else is able to trigger this process? Maybe it's everybody. Maybe there's certain people who are assigned to looking out for conflict and make those referrals of, Hey, let's start a process.  

Step two, an application is made to the Poland done justice project. The application involves many parties, including an elder, the victim coordinator, probation officer, community members. This is where you gotta know which types of stakeholders does your conflict methodology include. 

In NVC, a lot of times it's just like one on one. It's about teaching people to communicate from I statements and to be able to really represent themselves to each other, but contrarily in restorative justice, you do wanna have some community elder or leader. 

You wanna have a support person for each of the people who is most directly involved in the conflict. You wanna have maybe community members that witnessed it or were affected by it. It's more of a process.  

Step three, the community justice committee makes a decision to accept or reject the application. The effect offender, victim justice system and community may provide input to the committee. Who's deciding in cases that are rejected end up going to court. 

That's an interesting factor of this system that if people choose not to participate in it, for some reason that it does actually get escalated to the traditional justice system, in this case, it would be tribal court. Then if the case is accepted, the committee makes a decision on when, where, and who to include in the circle sentencing process. 

Always letting your stakeholders know what to expect when to show up well ahead of time. People can be really prepared for this sensitive session step for the offender support group and the victim support group prepare for the circle. This may involve meetings and possible mediation between representatives of the groups.  

Step five, the circle sentencing hearing takes place. Now in restorative justice. This is often a long meeting, which is a good thing to build realistic expectations around when you are back at this last slide, number four, getting your team to agree to use that method. 

You want to say, Hey, I'm pitching this method for us to use, but just so anytime a conflict comes up, we can expect that it'll take two hours outta your life one day and another five of coordinating ahead of time. 

Step six here, the sentence is implemented in restorative justice. We would have a step 6.5 which is checking in on, we would have a post circle where we check in and find out if the sentence has been followed 

Step seven is that the the offender gets full acceptance back into their community. It's really valuable for folks entering this, to know what to expect at the end of this. To know that reintegration is possible and trust among their community is possible. That was all that I have for you guys on our, my presentation here. 

### Questions

I'd love to just open the floor for questions cause I've been talking at you guys a lot.  

(01:24:59)    
**Loie**:    If there's anything you wanna ask me or just final thoughts to share in our five minutes here, that'd be great.  

(01:25:09)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I want to say Loie, first thank you for sharing this with us. Also thank you because one year ago and we had this same conversation and you gave like these same steps that you numbered here and those are, those were, and those are some of the steps that we are trying to reproducing gravity. That's why we are having this training of the facilitators. We are also working on the cultural side. Like everything like takes shape and yeah, I really want to thank you because from not an active contribution every day, but with just one small contribution, it was like a big push for this project and for this community. 

(01:26:27)    
**Loie**:    Thank you so much, Juan. I appreciate those words.  

(01:27:11)    
**Speaker 18**:    And I also included a link for the people who hadn't heard of polarity mapping before. There's a couple of videos in the link that push you to it in case you had.  

(01:27:25)    
**Juan Carlos**:    And the, they are all like different mechanisms, but more or less they follow some of the steps that lo was mentioning. That's like a great really summer summarize of how to build your own conflict management system in your organization. Yeah, the idea of gravity and of this training is that some of you can also replicate or develop the, your own conflict management system in your organization. You can choose if you want to repeat some of the things that we do in gravity, or if you want to choose another method, but more or less yeah. The steps on what is necessary to build your system. If no one wants to jump, we can wrap up this call and yeah. If someone wants to share his, or her final thoughts  

(01:28:53)    
**Loie**:    If anybody wanted to share something they got during their breakout session convo, I'd love to hear that.  

(01:29:04)    
**Speaker 18**:    Well, it seemed to me that there were a lot that really applied across a lot of communities. Based on the screenshot for me, I thought NVC shadow work, polarity mapping, and S SP dynamic slash integral theories were the ones that jumped out at me for being applicable to a really broad amount of conflict resolution situations. They also do things like transform conflict and so on. That was what we were talking about in our breakout group.  

(01:29:45)    
**Loie**:    Great. Thank you. We are at the top of the hour here, I will just make one last little plug here. I recently joined Bitcoin as the people ops lead, and Bitcoin is doing a great job of committing to decentralized practices or leading a great community, decentralized people practices, which definitely includes conflict resolution. There's a really cool culture going on there right now, both in the company and the DAO. There are we're hiring. There are open jobs in Bitcoin, the company, and also get coined out. If any of y'all are looking to move more fully into a web three position, you're super welcome to reach out to me. I'd love to talk to you about it. Cause I know everybody in here has that awesome human, social and intelligence that I would love to see more of and work around. Thank you so much, everyone. This was a great session. I said, it's awesome. Being around conflict resolution there is a really rare opportunity for me, so well done and yeah. Have a great rest of your graviton training.  

(01:31:08)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Thank you, Lou. Thanks everyone.
