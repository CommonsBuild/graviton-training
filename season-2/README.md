“Rather than looking at conflict as a threat, we can see it as providing opportunities to grow and increase our understanding of ourselves, of others, and of our social structures.” — [J.P. Lederach](https://professorbellreadings.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/the-little-books-of-justice-peacebuilding-john-lederach-the-little-book-of-conflict-transformation-good-books-2014-1.pdf)

> **Methodology:** There is some content that is required to be understood for a full comprehension before each session, that is referred to as **pre-learning.** Each facilitator will lead a **Presentation or a Workshop** and is free to choose if leaving additional information as **Homework**. Our intention is to Give people a study guide (general overview) of processes that need continued education and practice, to foster a culture of competence around solving the problems that can arise.
