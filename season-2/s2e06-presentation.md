### WHO AM I?

REGIS CHAPMAN - DURGADAS

HTTPS://SILENTMOTIONYOGA.COM

### CONTEXT: POSITIONALTY
**HOW CAN A WHITE MAN TALK ABOUT DECOLONIZATION?**

- My positionality is largely hidden since, on the surface, I am:
  - Tall, White, Male
  - Appear “well spoken”
  - Due to vocabulary and reading a lot, I appear to have perhaps have degrees
  - I appear confident in speaking in front of people
  - My wife has two degrees, A Gold medal in the Commonwealth Games, Silver medal in the Pan Am Games and a Bronze medal in the Olympic Games. 

- My positionality actually is:
  - Late bloomer, autistic
  - Formerly terrified of public speaking due to shame from narcissistic abuse
  - I am a largely self-taught lifelong learner
  - Work at a native band
  - Have a highly accomplished brown woman as a partner, who I must witness being abused on a constant basis due to racism and sexism.

### CONTEXT: TWO WAYS TO THINK
**HOW HUMANS ARE HAVING *HUMAN EXPERIENCES* IN A TIMELESS, INFINITE, UNCHANGING REALITY**

[WATCH: STROKE OF INSIGHT VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyyjU8fzEYU)

#### DIVIDED
- Bicameral Brain, Left Side
- Serial Processor, Linear Thought
- PATTERNS, PAST, PROJECTIONS
- Language, Details & Differentiation
- Visual Processing Focused on objects
- CMYK Color Model produces Black
- Externalization of costs
- Ethics

[WATCH: The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World](https://youtu.be/SbUHxC4wiWk)

#### UNIFIED
- Bicameral Brain, Right Side
- Parallel Processor, Non-Linear Thought
- NOW, CONTEXT
- CANNOT differentiate
- Visual Processing focused on relationships
- RGB Color Model produces white
- Response-ability

### CONTEXT: TWO SOCIAL FORMS
**HOW HUMANS ARE HAVING *SOCIAL EXPERIENCES* IN A TIMELESS, INFINITE, UNCHANGING REALITY**

#### DIVIDED
- Colonizer Worldviews dominate
- Unified Cultures are genocided and appropriated.
- Abrahamic Traditions Objectify Unity (“Sky Gods”)
- Merchants Assess Objects Using “Value” using highly objectified and technical languages like English and - accept only written texts as evidence.
- Creates Hierarchies By Default, Resulting In Violence, holarchies considered impossible.
- Visual Perception & Philosophy Emphasize Individuals & Reductionistic Approaches
- Psychological effects of cultural influences result in increasing narcissism and narcissistic abuse among participants over time.
- Good=Compliance, Evil=Non-Compliance To Social Contract/Hierarchy.

#### UNIFIED
- Pre-Colonization & Highly Unified Worldviews dominate
- Divided Cultures cannot survive and are absorbed through the sheer flexibility and resilience of the approach.
- Shamanic & Dharmic Traditions Contextualize Objects In A Totality
- Citizens Assess Objects in “Relative” ways using contextualized, oral traditions and sonically diverse languages.
- Creates & exists inside holarchies by default. Mechanisms (like the potlatch) exist to flatten the inevitable hierarchies that form.
- Visual Perception & Philosophy Emphasis Contextualizations At Every Level
- Psychological effects result in Overview Effect and relational thinking among participants over time.
- Good=Inclusive Thinking & Behavior, Evil=Exclusive Thinking & Behavior
- Morals

### CONTEXT: TWO MONETARY SYSTEMS
**HOW HUMANS ARE EXPERIENCING THEIR *FINANCIAL LIVES* INSIDE AN ABUSIVE SYSTEM**

#### DIVIDED
- Extractive/Exploitative
- Centralized yet Imbalanced: Smaller Selectorate/Less distributed agency and power/dictatorship
- Creates gap between signal and signified
- Decouples market from produced value, therefore creating a secondary market that exists ONLY to game the system; Value exchanged can be fabricated
- False Scarcity 
- Aggregates wealth for a few
- Limiting choice for everyone else, even entire countries

#### UNIFIED
- Aligned/Generative
- Decentralized and Balanced: Larger Selectorate/More distributed agency and power/democracy
- Disintermeditated (direct access to product, service or information) aka decentralized
- Connects market to value and to consumers
- Distributes wealth for everyone
- Creates choice for everyone


### CONTEXT: INTELLECTUAL APPROACHES
**HOW HUMANS ARE HAVING *PHILOSOPHICAL&PERCEPTUAL* EXPERIENCES IN A TIMELESS, INFINITE, UNCHANGING REALITY**

#### DIVIDED
- Educational system focused on external objects given positive value by the society, not the student nor the mind of the student; nor “Reality” itself.
- Materialistic Worldviews dominate (Science Delusion) and limit the available evidence, focusing on patho-myths and denialism.
- Objectivity and Subjectivity are misunderstood as “a very very very long list of objects” and individual perception is completely denied, dismissed and distrusted rather than understood.
- Unified Cultures are appropriated, demeaned and degraded, resulting in enormous misunderstandings and failure to benefit from the syncretic approach they possess. 
- Focus On “Being Right” within the hierarchy’s ‘value’ system. “Right” (according to the social contract) is PARAMOUNT ABOVE ALL ELSE. Therefore “beliefs” supersede all other rationality.
- Intellectuals Assess Concepts, Values, and Objects Using “Value”, based on the orthodoxy of their culture, resulting in an imbalance of thinking. Extending the senses is a primary means of knowledge.
- “Hard Sciences” preferred due to materialist bias, while psychology and even history are seen through the rigid orthodoxies that actively subvert and prevent their understanding.
- Visual Perception & Philosophy Emphasize Individuals & Reductionistic Approaches above all else: DESCARTES: “I think, therefore I am.”

#### UNIFIED
- Educational system focused on the student, and their mind’s ‘lensing’ of Reality and their roles within themselves, the family unit, the social fabric and the world and the universe itself; forming a cohesive approach to both inner and outer life.
- Mythologies are used as unified frameworks for imparting vast, complex and contextual understandings for multiple levels of learner development and maturity levels along the path to knowledge of all the roles an individual plays, as previously mentioned.
- The apparent division between Objectivity and Subjectivity in perception was solved thousands of years ago.
- Divided Cultures are understood to be immature expressions of a whole, even while suffering under the abuse they mete out.
- Subverting “belief” altogether is a primary means of knowledge. “The Knowledge That, Being Known, Nothing Else Remains To Know.”
- Intellectual activity is validated and contextualized in terms of being balanced between openness and discrimination.
- Creates & exists inside holarchies by default. 
- Visual Perception & Philosophy Emphasis Contextualizations At Every Level: Advaita Vedanta: “I Am, Therefore I Think”, since existence precedes Thought.

### CONTEXT: TWO SOCIALIZATION SYSTEMS
**HOW HUMANS ARE EXPERIENCING THEIR SOCIAL LIVES INSIDE AN ABUSIVE SYSTEM**

#### DIVIDED
- “Safety In Numbers Of People Who Think Like Me”
- LEGAL DRUGS (alcohol especially) are destructive, addictive and socially acceptable since they actively encourage violence, division and poor outcomes; and as such reinforce the control scheme, even when someone is trying to have a good time.

#### UNIFIED
- Harmony of Inner and Outer Truth
- ILLEGAL DRUGS (psilocybin, cannabis,peyote, etc.) are previously pre-colonized ways to see beyond duality are reduced to “hallucinations” as a way to prevent people thinking beyond the pre-determined control scheme.

### CONTEXT: HEALTH APPROACHES
**HOW HUMANS ARE HAVING *PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL* EXPERIENCES IN A TIMELESS, INFINITE, UNCHANGING REALITY**

#### DIVIDED
- DRUGS CHOSEN OVER MEDICINE, largely due to extractive Big Pharma profiting from it- meanwhile Big Pharma patents SO MANY native and folks medicines throughout the world in an identical way to Disney’s Mickey Mouse law that co-opts all of the Public Domain.
- COPING MECHANISMS, SO MANY COPING MECHANISMS

#### UNIFIED
- MEDICINE
- HEALING

### CONTEXT: INTELLECTUAL APPROACHES
**HOW HUMANS ARE HAVING *PHILOSOPHICAL AND PERCEPTUAL* EXPERIENCES IN A TIMELESS, INFINITE, UNCHANGING REALITY**

#### DIVIDED
- GAME A
- The ONLY Game in Town
- Basin Of Attraction
- Creates Hijacked Evolutionary trends, e.g.:
- Crappy sugary food creates food addicts/diabetics
- Pharmaceutical companies profit from insulin production 

#### UNIFIED
- GAME B

### CONTEXT: INTELLECTUAL APPROACHES
**HOW HUMANS ARE HAVING *ARTISTIC & CREATIVE* EXPERIENCES IN A TIMELESS, INFINITE, UNCHANGING REALITY**

#### DIVIDED
- Perspectival
- Block/Disown/Project

#### UNIFIED
- Aperspectival
- Intentional Deconstruction

### WHAT IS COLONIZATION?

- The dark side of "Western Modernity"; the other half of "Western Progress."
- A practice of domination by subjugating people.
- Imperial, economic, and political control over people and territory.
- Often includeing transfer of people (e.g. settler colonialism)

**ASSERTION: COLONIZATION IS A WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL & GOVERNANCE-LEVEL EXPRESSION OF NARCISSISTIC ABUSE**
- One can see this as the following approaches to recovery from Narcissistic Abuse are identical in approach, different in context:
- A person escaping an abusive partner (intimate relationships)
- A person recovering from being raised by a narcissist (family relationships)
- A person recovering from being indoctrinated by education facilities, [colleges](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jan/14/rhodes-must-fall-oxford-colonialism-zimbabwe-simukai-chigudu) and other “public” instruction.
- Social justice movements- ([who are protesting the horrific, genocidal and normalized colonized cultural violence](https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/08/09/black-lives-matter-is-not-a-terrorist-organisation) of our working people, everywhere; [and are thus labeled “terrorists”](https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/08/09/black-lives-matter-is-not-a-terrorist-organisation)) to the [now-pervasive perjorative SJW term](https://fee.org/articles/how-the-term-social-justice-warrior-became-an-insult/). How Social Justice ([the idea that “1) things are not right and that 2) the government should make them right. Where right all too often means cosmic justice, trying to set things right means writing a blank check for a never-ending expansion of government power.”](https://fee.org/articles/thomas-sowell-social-justice-philosophy-is-a-blank-check-for-government-power/)) itself has been co-opted to mean “expansion of government power”.
- Environmentalist movements ([who are protesting the horrific, genocidal and normalized colonized cultural violence](https://grist.org/article/the-term-eco-terrorist-is-back-and-its-killing-climate-activists/) of our planet, everywhere and are thus labeled “terrorists”)
- [Animal rights movements](https://theintercept.com/2019/03/23/ecoterrorism-fbi-animal-rights/) (who are [protesting the horrific, genocidal and normalized colonized cultural violence](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43267209?seq=1) of animals everywhere [and thus labeled “terrorists”](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17539150903010715?scroll=top&needAccess=true&journalCode=rter20))
- The MANY countries who have declared Independence Days from England and other European countries “World-wide, British Leaving Day is never out of season.” –Walter Russell Mead
- ['Colonialism had never really ended': my life in the shadow of Cecil Rhodes](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17539150903010715?scroll=top&needAccess=true&journalCode=rter20)

It’s important to note that ALL co-opted institutions from such countries are conscripted to enforce this violent, exclusionary and often genocidal warfare to ensure compliance, and this is a feature of narcissistic abuse at every level of its expression from intimate relationships to the entire world. 

#### BROKEN INFORMATION ECOLOGY
It is easy to see this just by looking at current events and to look deeper at [The War On Sensemaking Daniel Schmachtenberger](https://youtu.be/7LqaotiGWjQ).

### TYPES OF COLONIZATION
**UNDERSTANDING THESE IS KEY TO SPEAK TO THESE TOPICS**
#### COLONIALITY- [LINK](https://www.igi-global.com/dictionary/the-ambit-of-ethics-in-the-south-african-academic-institutions/44165) [LINK2](https://www.academia.edu/8843946/Coloniality_the_darker_side_of_Western_modernity)
- Distinct from Colonization- most of what I talk about in this presentation is Coloniality and not Colonization per se.
- The Shadow side of Colonization
- Patterns of power established by colonization
- Survives beyond colonization
- Defines culture, knowledge production, epistemology, relationships

#### KYRIARCHY
- Social Inertia that perpetuates intersectional oppression

### LAYERS OF ABUSE
![](https://imgur.com/m0Th9ch)

### WHAT IS OPPRESSION?
We are using Yoga for this example. 
- Arising from power + prejudice
- Systemic institutional power
- Power of self-definition
- Influence, resources, capital, gatekeepers, etc.
- Power of subjugation
- Internalized socialization to play roles of oppressors and oppressed
Slide Courtesy of Neil Dalal, PhD

### WHAT IS DECOLONIZATION?
We are using Yoga for this example. 
- Recentering epistemologies, systems, voices of the colonized (e.g. S.Asian voices in Yoga)
- Disrupting and delinking from systemic Western Eurocentric epistemologies
- Remembering/understanding the histories of colonialism and racism
- Divesting from colonial practices and products
- Repatriating tangible and intangible artifacts
- Undoing colonial systems of oppression
- Undoing extraction and exclusion.
- Equality: undoing asymmetrical power dynamic differentials.
- Magnifying different voices (those of the silenced) 
- Reframing subjectivities - decondiioning internalizaed oppression roles.
  - A process for both (neo) colonizaer and colonized.
Slide Courtesy of Neil Dalal, PhD

### WHAT IS ORIENTALISM?
We are using Yoga for this example. 
- "An ontological and epistemological distinction made between 'the Orient' and (most of the time) 'the Occident'" (E. Said) 
- Projection of a false binary: Misrepresenting "Western" and "Eastern" cultures.
  - The West as rational, logical, analytical, modern.
  - The East as irrational, mystical, spiritual, primordial, exotic, primitive
- The "good Orient" existed long ago
- But present-day Orient is corrupted, unruly, chaotic
- Westerners needing to protect the Indian past (Yoga) without requiring modern day S. Asians. -Reinforcing ideological control. 
Slide Courtesy of Neil Dalal, PhD

### POST-TRUTH POST-RACE POST-COLONIZATION

THE IRONY OF THE TITLE OF THIS PRESENTATION IS THAT NONE OF THESE TERMS ACTUALLY EXIST IN REALITY.

THIS INITIAL UNDERSTANDING(OR LACK THEREOF) WILL TYPICALLY BE INFORMED BY THE LEVEL OF PRIVILEGE OF THE PERCEIVER.

WE WILL EXAMINE WHY THIS IS, NEXT.

### THE LEGACY OF NARCISSISM
- ASSERTION: COLONIZATION IS A WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL & GOVERNANCE-LEVEL EXPRESSION OF NARCISSISTIC ABUSE THAT PRODUCES FAMILY “DYNASTIES” BOUND TO ITS INFLUENCE.

![](https://i.imgur.com/WAq9csd.png)

#### ASSERTION: COLONIZATION IS A NOW-NORMALIZED EXPRESSION OF NARCISSISTIC ABUSE

[**VICTIMS OF NARCISSISTIC ABUSE**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_abuse): This Wikipedia article show the following effects, easily seen in modern society and the governed around the world, at all times, but particularly now. Some relevant excerpts from this article:

**SELF-STIGMA**: Self stigma is the process in which a person internalizes the stigma and stereotypes around them by applying them to the self. This can lead to problems with self-esteem, depression and identity.

Research has shown that the public is less likely to think individuals with personality disorders need professional help and instead hold the belief that those with personality disorders should be able to exhibit control over behaviours caused by said disorders, combined with the clinical belief that people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder are untreatable. Low public mental health literacy has been linked to low treatment-seeking from those suffering from disorders the sufferers themselves stigmatize. Narcissistic personality disorder has notably low treatment-seeking behaviour, most often seeking treatment for less stigmatized comorbid issues.

**MODERN THEORIES**: Current point of view of modern psychiatrists believe that today's society is at fault for the increase in narcissistic abuse because society promotes competitiveness. Many features of narcissism are sources of success in the modern competitive society. The question is that to what extent the opportunistic abilities to bring out one's own proficiency and constantly strive for the better result in trample on other people and having an irresponsible and insensitive attitude to other people (see e.g. Lucher, Huston, Walker & Alex Houtson, 2011).

In 2011 Maatta, Uusiautti & Matta published a study with an indication that modern society may shape the patterns of narcissistic abuse. The ideas of pleasing yourself first, taking care of yourself, climbing the ladder and general success in life are desired traits. And the explanation for the increase in narcissistic disorders may at least partly be found in the societal development as competitiveness, individualism, and opportunism are admired - those exact features that are often typical of narcissists.

#### ASSERTION: COLONIZATION IS A WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL & GOVERNANCE-LEVEL EXPRESSION OF NARCISSISTIC ABUSE

[COMPONENTS OF NARCISSISTIC ABUSE](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/toxic-relationships/201709/how-spot-narcissistic-abuse): This Psychology Today article lists the following components, easily seen in modern society and governance around the world, at all times, but particularly now.

- VERBAL ABUSE
- MANIPULATION
- EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL
- GASLIGHTING
- COMPETITION
- NEGATIVE CONTRASTING 
- EXPLOITATION & OBJECTIFICATION 
- SCAPEGOATING 
- LYING
- WITHOLDING
- NEGLECT
- PRIVACY INVASTION
- CHARACTER ASSASSINATION/SLANDER
- VIOLENCE
- FINANCIAL ABUSE
- ISOLATION

Quoting the same article: “Malignant Narcissism and SociopathySomeone with more narcissistic traits who behaves in a malicious, hostile manner is considered to have “malignant narcissism.” Malignant narcissists aren’t bothered by guilt. They can be sadistic and take pleasure in inflicting pain. They can be so competitive and unprincipled that they engage in anti-social behavior. [Paranoia](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/basics/fear) puts them in a defensive-attack mode as a means of self-protection.” 

This is the literal approach of all “modern civilizations”. 

**THE TECHNIQUES OF NARCISSISTIC ABUSE**

EXAMPLE: SCIENCE DENIAL

[![](https://i.imgur.com/7MgKw7p.jpg)](https://crankyuncle.com/a-history-of-flicc-the-5-techniques-of-science-denial/)

#### Cycle of Narcissistic Abuse - Idealize, Devalue, Discard
![](https://i.imgur.com/gmRjEib.jpg)

### THE PEDAGOGY OF CULTS
**COLONIZED HUMANS ARE ESSENTIALLY TAUGHT TO OBJECTIFY THEMSELVES AND EVERYTHING ELSE, WITH THEIR PSYCHOLOGY DEFINED AS ‘OBJECTS OF GREATER OR LESSER VALUE’ BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE PRIVILEGE AND SOCIAL STATUS IN AN INTERLOCKING WORLDWIDE SYSTEM OF ABUSE.**
This is the basis of all the biases, prejudices and negative –isms like racism, sexism, trans-phobia or people who just lack compliance in the social contract in ANY form at all. 

Since our culture’s primary expression of “culture” is a relentless drive toward creating objects of all types, it is extremely adept at appropriation as well, since appropriation is the literal aim of ALL colonization strategies. Every type of violence is authorized in the acquisition of valuable objects, by every hierarchical layer. 

Similarly, every type of violence is authorized in the pursuit of maintaining the rigid orthodoxies required by narcissists. This is very similar to the behavior of cults, and it’s true our society has “cult behavior” as an almost-ideal compliance mechanism.

Since abuse is narcissistic by its nature, requiring the “othering” of one object in favor of another (usually one’s identified egoic self, created, educated and maintained by the culture), then one can see it isn’t far from that to violence to ensure compliance to the hierarchy.

- [The Narcissist’s Family Cult](https://youtu.be/sWY05MadRJk):  Youtube Video by Meredith Miller
- [How Being In A Cult Is JUST LIKE being in a Narcissistic Relationship](https://youtu.be/6bom1fyS6Ro): Youtube Video by Doctor Ramani

### THE PATHOLOGY OF PRIVILEGE
**COLONIZED HUMANS OPERATE IN A SEVERELY LIMITED AND HOLLOW SELF-UNDERSTANDING DUE TO THE GENERATIONAL ABUSE BY THE ENTIRE CULTURE SO PERVASIVE THEY CAN NO LONGER PERCEIVE IT OR SUBVERT IT.**
Privilege is a state of denial of Reality, combined with a social contract that says the ‘privileged’ will never be made to feel the actual consequences of their attitudes, ignorance, bias or actions. 

Such a psychological state can ONLY exist inside a systemic structure completely defined by abuse, in which a relatively lessened state of abuse is configured hierarchically so that one perpetually “fights” for a higher ‘privilege’ status, which is essentially permission to exist in the false duality of “abuser” and “abused” from one hierarchical step to another; granting ‘permission’ to the higher status for more ability to abuse and lessening of the expectation of receiving abuse or accountability. 

So it is seen that in such a system, defining and naming and assessing the various overlapping hierarchies is primary work in the mind of its participants; making it difficult for anyone to spend time considering or even knowing of the existence of non-hierarchies or even just gaps between hierarchies. 

Even our feeling of restriction based on these hierarchical systems is given an outlet in the form of yet another hierarchy, to the degree that even a super-rich ultra-privileged person continues to feel like an oppressed underdog and whose only approved cultural method of coping is to overcompensate with ego. 

[Tim Wise’s 2016 Youtube Video On A Race-Focused View Of The Pathology Of Privilege](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O81L6JRcGYw)

Notable Mentions from the video: “Journal Of The American Medical Journal found that Americans have twice the incidence of anxiety disorders above the global average and 5 TIMES that of Nigeria, which is almost constantly war-torn?” PRIVILEGE BLINDS US TO REALITY and so makes us anxious, since at SOME level we know we’re in a culture predicated on Narcissistic Abuse.

### THE PARADOX OF LARGE VS. SMALL
**HOW THOSE “IN CHARGE” OF THE COLONIZER MENTALITY CO-OPT THE EFFICIENCY INHERENT IN THE ‘LARGENESS’ TO MANIPULATE THE DESIRE FOR ‘SMALL AND LOCAL’ REACTIONISM TO THE ‘LARGENESS’ AND POWER HAD BY TECHNOLOGY AND BROAD INCLUSIVE FRAMEWORKS.** 

Why does it seem that so many right wing and “conservative” movements emphasize “making government smaller” while using the tools of that large government work against those who agree that government should be smaller?
  
[Adorno on the Far-Right (1967)](https://youtu.be/Ctil1Luc1m0)

An excellent translation (from Comments on that video by the user “Project Malus”): 
- Have to make mistakes to learn, so if the "overall social purpose falls by the wayside" perhaps this comes from an evolutionary trait where small groups favored trust and openness.
- An increase in size meant a loss of focus, an increase in fear, a loss of the very thing the small group offered, safety and efficiency.
- The "rightness" of the far right is in devolving the large group back into the smaller. The 'wrongness" of the far left is in lack of efficiency of that group size which demands more control, which excludes, which needs fixing (enter the far left) and this costs more.
- A high cost of living is a loss of freedom. This increases fear and so the swing back into the far right which offers the power (safety, efficiency) of the small group along with a fear ideology which translates as a desire for more power. 
- This false power is always manifested as loud noise and loss of individuality...the power of clapping as one, the machine power, which is in the efficiency of doing but translated by the right wing as making the individual more powerful. 
- I can do more, so I feel like God: there's the fascism start which can be harnessed.

Thus we can see how and why people like Steve Bannon LOVE things like the Anti-Fragile movement, which shows the Single Points Of Failure in which the need for the Local methods shown in Ostrom’s Principles for managing the commons to be respected by the Regional and the Regional to be respected by the National and the National to be respected by the World can be subverted into suspicion of ANYTHING beyond the Local, EVEN WHILE being manipulated and controlled by the Nationalist.

This reveals a flaw in hierarchical thinking overall (and divided thinking in general) and WHY we need to move into holarchies SO MUCH. Since all hierarchies result in someone occupying a “blocking” position (like Steve Bannon does in modern politics), regardless of WHICH hierarchy we are speaking about. **ALL hierarchy serves divided thinking**. This is one of the implications of a quote like “The Medium Is The Message”, for example.

### THE PARADOX OF LARGE VS. SMALL

[TERRITORIES by Rush](https://youtu.be/RvM387NJTYg)

I see the Middle Kingdom between Heaven and Earth
Like the Chinese call the country of their birth
We all figure that our homes are set above
Other people than the ones we know and love

In every place with a name
They play the same territorial game
Hiding behind the lines
Sending up warning signs

The whole wide world
An endless universe
Yet we keep looking through
The eyeglass in reverse
Don’t feed the people
But we feed the machines
**Can’t really feel
What international means**

In different circles
We keep holding our ground
Indifferent circles
We keep spinning round and round

We see so many tribes — overrun and undermined
While their invaders dream of lands they’ve left behind
Better people — better food — and better beer
Why move around the world when Eden was so near?

**The bosses get talking so tough
And if that wasn’t evil enough
We get the drunken and passionate pride
Of the citizens along for the ride**

They shoot without shame
In the name of a piece of dirt
For a change of accent
Or the colour of your shirt
**Better the pride that resides
In a citizen of the world**
Than the pride that divides
When a colourful rag is unfurled

### THE PARADOX OF LARGE VS. SMALL
**SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF PITTING LARGE AGAINST SMALL**
In many ways, Elinor Ostrom’s important work on Governing The Commons is important BECAUSE it shows a framework for how to include the large and the small.

### THE PROPHET- ON SELF-KNOWLEDGE

And a man said, "Speak to us of Self-Knowledge."

And he answered, saying:

Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.
But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart's knowledge.
You would know in words that which you have alwas know in thought.
You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.
And it is well you should.
The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea;
And the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.
But let there be no seals to weigh your unknown treasure;
And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.
For self is a sea boundless and measureless.
Say not, "I have found the truth," but rather, "I have found a truth."
Say not, "I have found the path of the soul." Say rather, "I have met the soul walking upon my path."
For the soul walks upon all paths.
The soul walks upon a line, neither does it grow like a reed. 
The sould unfolds itself, like a lotus of countless petals.

#### THE PROPHET- ON TEACHING

> The teacher who is indeed wise does not bid you to enter the ouse of his wisdom but rather leads you to the threshold of your mind. - Khalil Gibran

**WAKING UP**
[Tim Wise on Interrogation of the Lens with which We View Social Reality-](https://youtu.be/_N6Nb2y-CJ4) Becoming aware of the lens through which we see Reality makes you less a victim of your own biases. This principles is a PRIMARY way of regaining autonomy and agency against this abusive culture.  

**SELF-ACCEPTANCE**: You must begin with yourself, and to validate yourself as the ground floor of your progress. The degree to which you are willing to extend this to yourself is the degree to which you can extend it to others.
**SELF-COMPASSION**: In order to extend compassion to others, one MUST be willing to extend it toward one’s self, and to do so actively and with intention and determination, ESPECIALLY WHEN society or others in your social group are unwilling to. The degree to which you are willing to extend this to yourself is the degree to which you can extend it to others.
**SELF-REGULATION**: You have a right to boundaries, even inside yourself. The degree to which you are willing to extend this to yourself is the degree to which you can extend it to others. 
**SELF-EXPRESSION**:  Your Voice. The degree to which you are willing to extend this to yourself is the degree to which you can extend it to others.
**SELF-AWARENESS**:  Your meta-understanding of your own thoughts and disconnecting from “beliefs/ideologies” as identifiers. The degree to which you are willing to extend this to yourself is the degree to which you can extend it to others.

**NON-VIOLENT COMMUNICATION (NVC)**: Leads to the understanding of feelings and their link to needs, as well as how to communicate in a healthy way through observations and requests vs. judgements & demands. Communicate in ways that serve life and avoid the creation of enemy images.

### SUBVERTING OUR PRIVILEGE: PART 1
**WAKING UP:**
**DECOLONIZATION IS OFTEN STARTED BY A KIND OF PSEUDO-SPIRITUAL AWAKENING TO THE “LIE OF SOCIETY”**

#### DIVIDED STRATEGIES OF ABUSERS

- I’m confused
- I am ignorant
- I am in denial
- I’m co-dependent
- I have Learned Helplessness
- I also can feel power by abusing

### ASSERTING OUR RIGHT TO UNDERSTANDING

**THE ANATOMY OF A MISTAKE**
![](https://i.imgur.com/nFjz4KZ.png)

DECOLONIZATION IS OFTEN CONTINUED BY REVISIONING THE RELATIONSHIP OF SELF TO SOCIETY AND TO THE WORLD/UNIVERSE, NOW AS A WHOLE.

TO DO THIS ONE MUST REALIZE THE ROLE THE MIND PLAYS IN LENSING YOUR EXPERIENCE IN EACH RELATIONSHIP TO EACH.

EVEN SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY SUFFERS FROM THIS NARCISSISTIC ABUSE (SCIENTISM), AS YOU CAN SEE FROM RUPERT SHELDRAKE’S BANNED TED TALK ON:

### THE PEDAGOGY OF FREEDOM
**CLEAN UP**
[Tim Wise on Interrogation of the Lens with which We View Social Reality-](https://youtu.be/_N6Nb2y-CJ4) Becoming aware of the lens through which we see Reality makes you less a victim of your own biases. This principles is a PRIMARY way of regaining autonomy and agency against this abusive culture.  

**THE REAL HISTORY LESSON**: This is important because one must RESEARCH IT to find it out, and most importantly STOP DENIAL. The combination of gaslighting, manipulation and withholding information will create a personal tendency to follow the general culture’s approach to this deep denial also.
**SELF-COMPASSION**: In order to extend compassion to others, one MUST be willing to extend it toward one’s self, and to do so actively and with intention and determination, ESPECIALLY WHEN society or others in your social group are unwilling to.
**NON-VIOLENT COMMUNICATION (NVC)**: (SEE GRAPHIC NEXT PAGE) Leads to the understanding of feelings and their link to needs, as well as how to communicate in a healthy way through observations and requests vs. judgements & demands. Communicate in ways that serve life and avoid the creation of enemy images.

#### OPEN UP
- **DE-MASK**: Masking is required in an abusive, narrow outlook; but one can be authentic and vulnerable in a new way when one Opens Up and removes the mask. 
  - **Autism**: Masking is a very common term
  - **Sexism**: Masking is literally required with makeup, certain types of dress, etc. often enforced by women themselves!
  - **Racism**: You ALWAYS have to know what the other is thinking, or your life is in danger; so the mask is more like ARMOR.
  - Etc. 
- **ANCIENT WISDOM TRADITIONS**: As we will see later, Ancient Wisdom Traditions outlined a way to become free, but all spiritual and religious traditions were well-establish PRIOR to the worldwide colonization problem, and so their approaches can often lead to spiritual narcissism, instead of freedom; as well as any number of other cul-de-sacs of thinking. This is largely due to the fact that these traditional practitioners have been systematically destroyed over time.

#### SHOW UP
- **DEVELOPMENTAL THINKING**
  - **SPIRAL DYNAMICS**: Grave’s work was later extended into AQAL (SEE GRAPHIC IN FOLLOWING PAGES) by Ken Wilber, into a literal Theory Of Everything. For me, one of the main benefits of this approach is a way to extend the fundamental idea from NVC of Not Creating Enemy Images Out Of Anyone by showing how each person is coming from their own line, state or type of developmental perspective. 
  - **INTEGRAL THEORY**: An extension of Graves’, Beck and Cowan’s work to include a larger approach.
- **INTEGRATED LIVING**: Spreading around these deep insights into one’s life, work, and sustainable approaches to all things.

### FREEDOM: TWO SOCIAL FORMS
**COMMONS GOVERNANCE**

#### DIVIDED
- Assumptions of “rationality” often excludes many variables relevant to humanity

#### UNIFIED
- Pre-Colonization & Highly Unified Worldviews dominate
- Divided Cultures cannot survive and are absorbed through the sheer flexibility and resilience of the approach.
- Shamanic & Dharmic Traditions Contextualize Objects In A Totality
- Citizens Assess Objects in “Relative” ways using contextualized, oral traditions and sonically diverse languages.
- Creates & exists inside holarchies by default. Mechanisms (like the potlatch) exist to flatten the inevitable hierarchies that form.
- Visual Perception & Philosophy Emphasis Contextualizations At Every Level
- Psychological effects result in Overview Effect and relational thinking among participants over time.
- Good=Inclusive Thinking & Behavior, Evil=Exclusive Thinking & Behavior
- Morals

### SUBVERTING OUR PRIVILEGE: PART 2
**SPIRITUALITY, NEW AGE THINKING, TOXIC POSITIVITY AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT**

#### DIVIDED STRATEGIES- BLOCK/DISOWN/PROJECT
1. “Remaining Unattached:” Choosing to Be Silent
2. “Sending Love and Light:” Distancing Yourself
3. “Keeping Your Vibration High:” Encouraging Numbness
4. “Emphasizing the Spiritual Perspective:” Negating Reality
5. “Privileged Preaching:” Wielding Entitlement as The Way (New Age Prosperity Gospel)
6. “Recreating ‘Tribe’:” Barring Diversity from Your Comfort Zone
7. Free Speech As “Freedom From Consequences Of My Speech”
8. Overuse of Openness (It’s All Good, Everything’s Perfect Anyways, Agree With Any Buzzword-Laden Spiritualism) or Rationality (Denialism)

#### UNIFIED STRATEGIES
1. See Something, Say Something.
2. Show Up, Take Direct Action
3. Embrace Shadow, Tell Difficult Truth.
4. Engage with WHAT IS.
5. Be Humble. Listen. Don’t Victim-Blame.
6. Encourage and Find Unity In Diversity Of Age, Background, Knowledge, and Skills.
7. Free Speech As Truth Telling
8. Balanced and Appropriate Use of Rationality and Openness.


### TUNING INTO THE UNIFIED AND THE COMMONALITY
SELF-COMPASSION IS WHAT CONVERTS THE VARIOUS STRATEGIES OF ABUSE INTO HEALTH.

TOO OFTEN PEOPLE ESCAPE ABUSIVE APPROACHES INTO ANOTHER CULT-LIKE APPROACH.

EVEN WITH SPIRITUAL APPROACHES AND THIS FEEDS “SPIRITUAL BYPASSING” BY AVOIDING DIFFICULT SHADOW/TAMASIC ASPECTS OF THEIR PSYCHOLOGY.

**THE ANATOMY OF A SOLUTION**
![](https://i.imgur.com/nFjz4KZ.png)

### PRE/TRANS FALLACY
**CONFUSION ON THE ROAD TO PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH/UNITY**

RELATED TO SPIRITUAL BYPASSING IS THE PRE/TRANS FALLACY. SINCE BOTH PRE-CONVENTIONAL INFANTILE FEELINGS AND TRANS-PERSONAL FEELINGS ARE “NON-RATIONAL”, THEY ARE OFTEN EASILY CONFUSED, ESPECIALLY WHEN TAKING PSYCHOTROPIC/NOOTROPIC SUBSTANCES.

PRE-REDUCTIONIST/COLONIZED THINKING WOULD TEND TO CONFUSE THE PERSON HAVING A NON-RATIONAL EXPERIENCE TO THINKING THEY HAVE “REGRESSED” INTO FREUD’S ‘OCEANIC’ STATES.

TRANS- TRANSPERSONAL AND THE ‘GLORIOUS’ INTEGRATED NON-RATIONAL STATES CAN SEEM, TO THE INTERMEDIATE PRACTITIONER, LIKE REGRESSION AT FIRST; BUT TRANS-CONVENTIONAL THINKING HAS ACCESS TO CONVENTIONAL PSYCHOLOGY TO “TRANSCEND AND INCLUDE” WHEREAS PRE-CONVENTIONAL STATES DO NOT.

THE FUNDAMENTAL MANDATE OF YOGA:
“YOGA IS THE SUSPENSION OF THE MODIFICATIONS OF THE MIND”

ALL DHARMIC & SHAMANIC APPROACHES TO KNOWLEDGE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY UNIFIED AND NON-THEISTIC

#### DIVIDED
- **TAMAS**: The Hiding Power Of The Mind (Ignorance)
- **RAJAS**: The Projecting Power Of The Mind (Ego)
- Names & Forms
- Righteous Thinking
- Tossing Of The Mind (Vikshepa) between Ego and Ignorance
- Translative 
- Shadow Self (Spiritual, Cultural, Familial, Intimate)

#### UNIFIED

- Beyond Names & Forms
- The Problem With All Conclusions
- Overcoming The Perception Problem
- ‘Unlearning’ Thinking
- Maturity (ability to resolve dualities and paradoxes)

THE NATURAL INCLINATIONS OF ASPIRANTS

![](https://i.imgur.com/Scl3vUg.png)

### CONTEXT: THE SOCIAL EGO
**HOW ADDING EGO AND IGNORANCE TO ANY HUMAN ENDEAVOR DIVIDES IT.**

#### FOUR PATHS OF YOGA + EGO/IGNORANCE
- **KARMA YOGA**: Doership. “I” did some great thing for someone else. My Identity Is The Unique Change Agent.
- **BHAKTI YOGA**: Claiming Exclusivity. “My God” or “My Teacher” or “My Book” has some special access to the timeless, infinite, unchanging Reality and NO ONE ELSE.
- **RAJA YOGA**: Claiming ‘Powers’. Many useless physical feats of stamina and bodily control, plus nearly the entirety of modern colonized ‘yoga’ is really ‘bhoga’. 
- **JNANA YOGA**: Arrogance and Ivory Towers. Many people can overuse translative and book knowledge without transforming themselves or having an imbalanced approach to one or the other.

### THE SOCIAL EGO: OUT OF BALANCE
**POLITICS**

#### FOUR PATHS OF YOGA + EGO/IGNORANCE
- **KARMA YOGA**: Doership.  Explains the “claiming” behavior of all narcissistic governance.
- **BHAKTI YOGA**: Cult Behavior.  When the “ideology” or “orange” SD aspect is emphasized.
- **RAJA YOGA**: Claiming ‘Powers’. Many useless physical feats of stamina and bodily control, plus nearly the entirety of modern colonized ‘yoga’ is really ‘bhoga’. 
- **JNANA YOGA**: Arrogance and Ivory Towers. Many people can overuse translative and book knowledge without transforming themselves or having an imbalanced approach to one or the other.

#### DECOLONIZING YOGA AS AN EXAMPLE
[DECOLONIZINGYOGA.COM](https://decolonizingyoga.com/decolonize-yoga-practice/)

1. INQUIRE WITHIN: TRULY LEARN SELF-INQUIRY
2. EXPLORE, LEARN AND CITE CORRECT CULTURAL REFERENCES.
3. ASK OURSELVES, AND OTHER YOGA TEACHERS, THE HARD QUESTIONS.
4. LIVE, KNOW, SHARE AND PRACTICE ALL 8 LIMBS OF YOGA, NOT JUST ASANA.
5. BE HUMBLE AND HONOR YOUR OWN AND OTHER PEOPLE’S JOURNEY.

> “It was here that i started to apprehend the true meaning of colonization. Did you know that yoga and ayurveda were banned in india under british rule and colonization?
> 
> The practices millions of westerners now turn to for alternative health and wellness therapies were intentionally eradicated from parts of india to the point that lineages were broken and thousand-year old traditions lost.
> 
> To be colonized is to become a stranger in your own land. as a desi, this is the feeling i get in most westernized yoga spaces today. Of course, powerful practices that reduce suffering persist, despite all attempts to end them. These facts are critical to understanding the power and privilege we continue to possess or lack, to clarifying the positionalities we embody as we practice, teach and share yoga today.
> 
> Now, when so much of what the western world sees as true yoga is beautifully achieved physical postures, (accomplished, photographed and displayed by popular yoga magazines, journals and sites) executed by mostly young, white, stylish-yoga-apparel clad women and men, yogais going through a second colonization. This colonization is the misrepresentation of yoga’s intention, its many limbs, and its aims.
> 
> Yoga is not now, nor has it ever been, a practice aimed at physical mastery for its own sake. nor is it a practice aimed at “stress-reduction” so we can function as better producers and consumers in a capitalist society”
