### PRESENTATION / WORKSHOP

Intro: Acknowledgement of our teachers & the legacy of circle-based justice built by millenia of pre-colonial cultures

Restorative Justice Theory: Dispute resolution can be fully decentralized, and what does fully decentralized mean

- Are you in an org currently? Do you have a stated conflict process? Would you know what to do if a team conflict arose?
- Brainstorm what types of conflict resolution can you think of? Is there a centralized party in each of these?
- Why doesn’t centralization work? (Review current justice systems)
- Go over quotes from FTP and D. Barter

### Practical Implementation: How to set up a conflict res process in your org

- Selecting a method
- Facilitators
- Training for Facilitators
- Team agreement to use the method
- Time resolving conflict is paid time
- Company culture: Celebrate conflict!

### HOMEWORK
