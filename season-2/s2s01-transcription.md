## Transcription

(00:00:02)    
**Durgadas**:    This is the first session of the second graviton training. 

I'm Durgadas, I run a yoga center. I gove up everything I owned and lived in a Hindu monastery for about five years. This was after spending a lot of time working in Silicon valley. Also I've worked in Seattle for Microsoft. All the big companies you've ever heard of, I've probably worked for them. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/iWuBeA8.png)

This is a list of my major things in my life. I'm on the autism spectrum. I call myself a polymath because after years of consuming different special interests, I've acquired a number of things which over time have meant that I can do a lot of different things. 

I've been a computer geek since I was in eighth grade, taught myself machine language on an apple, two E also was a monk in a yoga and vedantic lineage. It's a shivananda organization, if any of you ever taken a yoga teacher training course, my guru invented those. 

I'm a Sally yoga teacher, NVC practitioner, I've founded three non-violent communication groups, coach elite endurance athletes. My wife is a former endurance athlete as well.  

I'm a writer. I do graphic and web design. Some of you'll see some of the graphics that I've designed today. I'm in the trusted seed and training Gravitons. 

I'm also married to a woman who has two degrees and some metals and some major competitions. She's very inspiring. She's also a social justice advocate. Right now, as up dealing with the fairy Creek blockade, trying to save the last old growth rainforest, so incredible motivation and help for me. 

> ### What Is A Schelling Point?
> **DEF**: A focal point (or Schelling point) is a solution that people tend to choose by default in the absence of communication.
> 
> GravityDAO’s aim is to generate, in our members & partner organizations, a proactive anti-fragile organizational culture through robust sensemaking, shared mental models & language systems, human-centric & ethical technology and services that bring us together even in the absence of communication.
> 
> This harmonizes with TEC’s mission to be the Schelling Point for Token Engineering.

In token engineering commons, we often talk about ourselves as a shelling point and I'm not sure that everyone knows what a shelling point is, but the idea behind the token engineering commons is that we would become a shelling point for token engineering. 

That is to say, we should become the people who other token engineers turn to and choose by default in the absence of communication or other options.  

(00:04:25)    
I've basically written this out to say that the idea behind gravity and the future gravity do is to generate within our members and the partner organizations who we service and the DAOs that we speak to: 

a proactive anti-fragile organizational culture through robust sensemaking, shared mental models & language systems.

Often we spend a lot of time trying to figure out what let's say, the right programming languages for doing a particular project, but we often don't spend time coming up with shared mental models and language systems in which we can discuss how cultural things can work. 

Often, because we don't do that, certain kinds of conflict can arise and, or the erosion of trust, which is a huge part of what we are here to do is to create trust. With human and ethical technology and services, that would bring us together even in the absence of communication.  

The whole purpose behind gravity is to find ways to do exactly this.

As gravitons, it's important to recognize that all people in our organizations contain a psychological shadow.

> ### Role of Gravitons
> 
> All people and organizations contain a psychological shadow, and the role of Gravitons is to be highly aware of the presence of BLOCK/DISOWN/PROJECT mechanisms and how they reveal themselves inside conflicts and how we can prevent their occurrence by establishing thorough systems of Trust Creation through effective Curation, Moderation and smooth Cross-pollination. 

Our job is to be highly aware of the presence of these when people are trying to do a positive thing, there is a BLOCK/DISOWN/PROJECT mechanism, which can come up and to become aware of how those things reveal themselves before and after conflict is already arisen. 

The point of being a graviton is to try to get to the point where you're creating trust and then manage it at the same time when those trust mechanisms have broken down. We're thinking both preventatively and in terms of trying to work out how to respond to those things effectively when things do occur. 

The third three basic mechanisms that I've talked about, that we do, where we typically, when we're speaking about trust creation in a online situation like this, it's often true that we have curated material that's come before us and we have moderators, and then we have cross pollination things which are happening.  

(00:07:10)    
**Durgadas**:    And so there's actually a fair amount that you need to know as a graviton, to both figure out how to create trust and to deal with it once it's once bad things are happening. At the point where we're here, in the middle as moderators to assist with all three of these processes. 

> ### Skills of Gravitons
> - COMPASSION
> - MINDFULNESS
> - SITUATIONAL AWARENESS
> - HIGH/BROAD-THINKING
> - STRONG CONTEXTUALIZING
> - CLARITY ON ACTION MODES (CYNEFIN)

Some basic skills for gravitons are number one is compassion, mindfulness, situational awareness, to understand what's going on to have really expansive thinking the ability to contextualize what's going on, and some clarity on action modes, which we'll get into in my second presentation, which will be number six in this series.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/hFQ8N65.png)

(00:08:01)    
This is a graphic, which explains it all in context. There's a lot going on here. Again this was developed with a view toward creating a DAO behind this, but these are all the different aspects of things that we're talking about in terms of gravitons. 

What's great about this is that we're actually going to be able to, as a graviton, you might feel drawn to one thing more than another. We will, we actually have book clubs around Ostrom's principles. We're gonna have a practice group and a book club around nonviolent communication. 

Those of you who are a bit more alternate distribution or dispute resolution and mediation, escalation, and eventually spinning up into the legal side of the picture, then you'll have these four different aspects to talk about. 

Primarily what I'd like to do is just cover them all in a broad way. Then talk specifically about the developmental thinking, how it can contextualize the rest of these things.

> ### Graviton's 'Unified Vision'
> Each of the four principles (A,B,C,D) is a tool to unify our thinking. Being Gravitons, our primary role is to think in unified ways when others cannot. Our role is to educate and expand our own and our group’s ability to remain unified against a variety of potential stimuli.
> 
> Using this lifelong learning and generative process (using the three approaches inside of our Graviton group- Curation, Moderation and Cross-Pollination) you can develop your ability to ‘see into’ the two general viewpoints of people divided by conflict. 

You'll notice that the four principles are ways of unifying. There are two hemispheres of the human brain. You have the left brain, which is the divided way of thinking, which is typical in the centralized world, the centralized corporate world, the centralized banking world. 

It's a very divided narcissistic approach to things where we externalize costs. There's an awful lot of the things that cryptocurrencies and token engineers are averse to in that universe. 

The whole point of being a graviton is to be able to heal things. You take the divided stuff and bring them back together. Each of these principles is a methodology for unifying, 

According to the different situations that we find ourselves in. Our primary role is to think in unified ways when other people cannot. 

Then the role is to educate and expand our group's ability to remain unified against a variety of potential stimuli that would seek to divide us. This is a lifelong learning process, and it's also very generative. 

I'll show you the generative almost cellular process that we're talking about with the curation moderation across pollination that you can develop in terms to see into the people who might be divided by conflict and to see through the situations that we find ourselves in. 

> ### PRINCIPLE A- DEVELOPMENAL THINKING
> TRUST CREATION- Proactive Efforts to identify places to engender trust not only in participants but also in investors, regulatory bodies, systems, etc. 
> - Cynefin- Frameworks Preceding Data (see graphic)
> - Spiral Dynamics & Integral Theory
>   - Deep Methods to contextualize efforts, people, community and world.
> - Deliberately Developmental Organizations
>   - How To Reward What We Want To Educate
>   - What A Culture Educates Is What It Becomes
>   - Metamodernism- caring about all of the psychological health of the participants in the system
>   - OK, We’ve Decentralized. Now What?
>     - Do we continue to just have the attitude that “Decentralization Fixes EVERYTHING?”
>     - Systems Thinking Vs. Complexity Thinking

Principal a is basically the idea that all the other principles are contextualized into in terms of trust creation, Cynefin is a framework that in which we can understand what action mode is required. 

That is to say, to create trust. You really have to respond appropriately to situations. If you're responding to a complex situation, which you need to experiment with something that you assume is a simplified known thing, that's gonna tend to erode trust. 

Whereas if you're responding in a complex way to a complex problem, then that's appropriate action mode to work with. Just having this developmental thinking and contextual thinking really helps, spiral dynamics and integral theory is also extremely helpful in terms of when we get into non-violent communication.  

One of the ways that you learn about non-violent communication is that you need to understand that it is actually something which is designed to prevent you from making an enemy image out of somebody and spiral dynamics. 

Integral theory is a very well developed developmental framework that enables you to, instead of looking at people who are behaving in a certain way and judging them and othering them, you can say, this person is behaving out of a red or blue or a green perspective. I could see why they would do that instead of doing something else. 

It prevents you from creating an enemy of a judge of people. We'll get into that in a bit. Then in terms of, where we're headed a bit in our organization is once you decentralize, then what do you do?  

Then how is it that you develop people individually in terms of the overall DAO space? And so we, as gravitons in many ways, by helping to bring people together. That is itself a developmental process. 

Developmental organizations, and we do a lot of this without explicitly calling ourselves this. We think about what it is that we want to reward and what we want to educate. It's important to note that what a culture educates as what it becomes. 

In many ways, by educating gravitons, we find good ways to create trust creation and to resolve conflicts before they get out of hand. All of this takes place in context of a meta modernist outlook, where we care about all the psychological health of all the participants in the, in our systems. 

What I was saying before about okay, we've decentralized now, what a lot of people are just like yay decentralization. The, there are, that actually creates the potential for a lot of trust creation mechanisms that can exist, that didn't exist in centralized systems. 

It also creates a lot of potential places where conflict can arise. Just understanding the context in which all of our efforts here in the token engineering commons are arising is one of the main purposes of this initial outlook.  

I would also say that systems thinking versus complexity thinking is an interesting thing to keep in mind is graviton because a systems thinker is really gonna be somebody who tops out at the good and best practice side of the picture, where the experimentation is done. 

Now we just are left with the complexity of the system. That's the system stinker and a complexity thinker, people who are willing to go down and down the road of doing experiments and not really knowing exactly what's happening. 

That's actually been the history of the token engineering commons up to now, and with this new gravity DAO and even the commons dao that's coming up, we're doing a lot of **complexity thinking**. 

It's important as gravitons to understand all of these contextual things to grasp what possible things you may find as you participate in conflicts and trust creation processes in the down space.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/ayvU3ll.png)

(00:18:34)    
This gets us into this cellular process of generating trust. Almost always, you're gonna be in a situation where you're gonna need to iterate something. The participation and iteration portions of this have a process to them. 

Each of them begins with, there's this thing we're gonna do. We typically promote that, and then there should be informed consent. Then we go through this process where we've taken that curated material, and we have somebody who's moderating it. 

This can also apply in many ways to the process we follow as gravitons in terms of moderation and that type of thing too. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/KQk4nyg.png)

Now, as a contextualize, the Aqua model here is what we're looking at. Each of these colors represents a developmental altitude. That is to say that there's a maturity as you go through certain kinds of systems. 

What I'll explain to you is there's a narrative framework that I use to talk about this as a person participating in the token engineering commons, you were your self and consciousness, and you were at a certain developmental level of whatever it is. 

Then you say, I'm going to interact with this culture and worldview of the token engineering commons. Then that token engineering commons is going to create a social system and environment and a discord and a forum and all these different things. Even the gravity group itself is one of those social systems.  

What basically happens after that is that something says brain and organism here, but really you could say that it is these various mental models and other technologies and processes that we've created. Then those systems interact again with the individuals involved in them. 

What you can see is that if you've got somebody who is coming in and this achiever self mentality, which is where a lot of cist things come from and you're then interacting with a pluralistic or an integral group the token engineering comments. 

The potential for conflict can exist there too, because then this person is typically going to think in scientific, rational ways. There could be a conflict between any of these colors. It's also true that you can see that organizations will typically operate on a cord.  

There's generally gonna be an anchor, something that's in the middle, and then they will work across these. A lot of corporations work on a red, blue orange setup. That's why there's all this centralization and everything is because there's a safety or safety and ancient nations idea, corporate states is the developmental social system that ends up being in that. 

That's why it doesn't really work with a lot of folks. Now people who want to participate in groups like token and engineering commons in a lot of DAO spaces are gonna be more value communities and integral commons than anything else. Some of the growing pains that you'll, you'll notice in the DAO spaces in our participants come from the mismatch of the individual consciousness and its development with the aims of both the culture of worldview and the social systems of those groups.  

### GRAVITON TOOLS: POLARITY MAPS

![](https://i.imgur.com/t9uH9Ki.png)

(00:22:58)    
**Durgadas**:    This is really helpful as a contextualizer to know the potential situations that you could be going into. We're gonna talk about some other tools that can help in terms of this too. One of those is polarity mapping. 

This is a very beautiful system, and there's a link to a training that I can give you. The introductory video by itself is worth the price of admission. Maybe we can find a way to purchase the polarity mapping course as a group, but it's just very beautiful. 

Some of you might have seen the SWAT analysis in the past, and what this basically does is it creates a situation where you're, you have the ability to resolve these polarities. For example, the deconflict between safety and innovation is often a common problem. This gives you a way to work this thing out. 

It's a bit too complex to describe only in this one thing, but what we'll try to do along with NVC and further talks about spiral dynamics, we can have another, hopefully follow up to how to resolve polarities.  

> ### GravityDAO- What we're working on 
> - We are currently constructing the DAO with the other Gravitons and participating DAOs
> - Get involved to influence and add to the pull of Gravity- It Brings Us Together!
> - DAO2DAO- finding ways to negotiate and find common trust and ground between DAOs

Now what we're currently working on is we're working on constructing the DAO with the other gravitons and participating DAOs. You guys not only are from getting POAPs, but also get to influence the future direction of the gravity DAO and what we're gonna work on. 

Anything you'd like to add, Juan?  

(00:25:35)    
**Juan Carlos**:    For sure.The idea is to be able to bring communities and community members together, even in this agreement. What we are trying to do is also to normalize talking about conflicts and that makes us more competent to deal with it. 

If we never talk about conflict in an organization, when conflict happens, everyone is gonna start running and pulling their hair without knowing what to do. It's important to understand that in these type of organizations, we need to have some justice systems and that everywhere you go, where there is a social organization, or like a group of people there's gonna be a justice system. 

It can be an invisible justice system that no one talks about. Not having a justice system is also a justice system.  

What we are trying to do is to recognize the importance of having a justice system to have yeah. Credibility and build trust over coordination in these type of communities. We can have several types of justice systems, but the justice system that we are trying to promote is based on mutual monitoring. 

When we were reading Ostrom, she says, it's very expensive to have like external monitors monitoring the actions of a community. What we are trying to do is to build competence within people in the community, so that the people inside the community act as peers supporting each other. 

That's why we're developing these skills. The training has like a lot of topics. We are starting with that contextualization and talking about creating trust, because, without trust, you cannot solve conflict. 

You have to trust that there is a system that is not biased in order for you to rely that the, that system is going to be ju fair with you and that it's not going to it's not going to influence the outcome of a decision.  

(00:28:36)    
**Durgadas**:    Those principles in particular are to care for the commons. What you'll notice is out in the centralized world, there is these pockets of greed and everything. That is now extended off into the commons too. You end up with the prisoners' dilemma and the tragedy of the commons and the fundamental principle of token engineering and what this was founded on was those from principles. 

The developmental thinking has come after, as a contextualize for that thing, but to care for the commons is part of that process as well. We don't just care about the commons we care about all the individual people. That's why principal C exists where we talk in terms of nonviolent communication, holding space for signal inside of noise, avoiding enemy image creation, and making sure that we're dealing with people in a humanistic fashion. 

What you'll notice is, as you move through this process is that the legality and the formality of this thing escalates as you start from principle A and go around to principle D.  

It's true that we need larger contextualizing principles and on the trust creation side being able to understand all these different things in terms of the first principle being also able to care for the commons, which is that part if you have two people in a relationship, there's a third thing, which is in the middle, which is the commons. 

If you're married, you have yourself and your partner, and then you have all your shared relationship and property and kids and all these other things in between you and it's caring for that. That is principle B and a lot of that negotiation and other things as principal C. 

Then when things really aren't working, we then go into principal D but at each aspect of this, we're trying to transform the conflict into something which is greater so that we can get back to the first principle. Is that reasonable?  

(00:31:07)    
**Juan Carlos**:    In this organizations where there is so much of a techno logical focus, sometimes we forget about the humanity and the human side and the human aspect of it. I feel that more and more, we are starting to talk about this because, these organizations are not only like enterprises, these organizations are also communities and these important for community members to support each other. 

In this context where we are spending so much time with people, we cannot feel that we only work and that we don't know the people who we are working with. Like we only know we only see avatars and we don't know about what the other persons struggle is. Our intention with this services is for people to request support in a variety of situations.  

Not only we have conflict with other people, sometimes we have internal conflict or sometimes we just want some advice of someone that can hear us in a safe space, and we need to develop that trust and that confident between people. 

The idea is that the people that pass this training can be seen in the community as an easy access agent to request support in a variety of situations. Yeah, it is to enforce and to power empower the human aspect of dos. We cannot have like organizations that exploit the human or that they are not comprehensive to human needs, but rather we need to have more comprehensive dos and for people to have an and joyful experience by participating.  

(00:33:22)    
**Durgadas**:    And so, in terms of second order stuff, part of the thing to understand is that it gives you an advantage as an employee, as an employer, as a DAO to have this thing, anchoring your culture and it's a really excellent skill both personally and professionally, and as a cultural context to have this entire framework understood. Is there anything else you have, Juan? Can I open it up to questions from folks?  

(00:34:03)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I just would like to say that also, and this is something that I'm going to talk in my next session, but that in this organizations, we also reproduce and organization identity of false self, where, everyone should be happy. Everyone should be always available to carry more load of work. 

Sometimes we are false. We don't voice out our concerns. The idea of having gravity in an organization is also to be able to have a safe space, to communicate and yeah. To talk about the things that normally we don't talk about and to feel that if something seems unfair, that there is people that is caring for the experience in people in their organization. 

Not only, okay, we are going to exploit people and, we only care for you because if you work for us, but if you stop working for us, we don't care. Why not even, why did you stop like contributing? 

We see a lot of conflicts between members in organizations, but it's not only important to be able to provide support in a professional way mediation when they dispute scale. That's why we are starting with this, but it's also important to have like a cultural understanding and a cultural effort to build trust and to build relationships and to build credibility within the system. 

That's why it's so important to have safe spaces to integrate and to let people like feel that their concerns can be expressed, because if we don't foster feedback, or if we don't have safe spaces for people to communicate, there will be a lot of things that will happen. We will, they will never be voiced out. 

People wont feel comfortable if they don't have one, a safe space to communicate. Warranties of that, what they're communicating will be processed as an input to the system.  

(00:36:49)    
**Durgadas**:    One of the things you'll notice is if you looking at this complicated graphic as trust creation is a general principle, it also has an impact on security. If we're creating token engineers and improving the lives of token engineers and teaching from an ethical standpoint we do in many of our technical things that the point of this is that we're dealing with money here. 

We're making tokens and things. Trust creation is almost the most important thing about this thing that we're talking about. Right. To having the reason why people put their money in banks is because they trust, they have a level of trust about that. 

It's not just for the participation in the token engineering or an individual DW, but also just for the overall ethical culture and promotion of ethical culture within this particular area of work. Any other questions at this time let's maybe Livy or some of the, your words can start.  

(00:38:03)    
**Speaker 4**:    My name is Jovian. I just wanted to second what Juan was saying. I really feel like when there is a conflict, when what we see as a conflict, it's the opening up of a space for complexity to be added into the perspective, unfortunate the collective perspective. Unfortunately if you look at it at like in a binary, oh, it's a failure. 

It's a failure for us to keep moving along with the same rules and expectations as we had before, or it's a failure in like universal adoption of the rules and expectations which we had, but a conflict is actually a hugely valuable opportunity to open up a new space to grow a root up or down or sideways or in a new direction towards creating a more complex perspective. 

Unfortunately, the hurriedness to resolve or brush under the rug, or decide a winner or loser, or to stay in this binary approach the rush, the roughness and the efficiency. That's like the mode that people are usually in. Yeah, just like giving someone an opportunity to view this as a valuable moment where like the organization can grow and it's collective intelligence can become more complex, is a really positive thing. I'm really glad you guys are doing this. Thank you.  

(00:39:50)    
**Durgadas**:    Well, and that's a very good observation. One of the things that you'll get, my second version of my training is the, this is viewpoint on the connection framework. Can you guys see, just sync says CIN now on it.  

This is actually what I was saying before about gravitons, we'll figure out what are the different action modes that work in terms of this and exactly what you just said is allowing for complexity. Right. What often we, what often has happened is that we have these known familiar bucketized rigid version of things. 

If you don't fit into that, then you end up falling off of this cliff and end up in chaos. Then if you can collect yourself and start experimenting with things then you can actually find solutions and then bring them back up and make more space in the known and familiar. In many ways, the token engineering comments, culture overall is working really hard to work backwards in this way. Even though things might seem chaotic in this space, we're experimenting on it, we're creating knowable things that might seem complicated and then bringing them a really tall ladder to make them clear and easier and simpler to understand. That's the DAO space in general., so that's our job as graviton is to help those people who are doing the complex. It's very beautiful that you actually recognize that. We'll get into that in session six that I'm teaching as well. Any other questions or comments?  

(00:41:49)    
**Speaker 5**:    I have a question. I'm new to all of this. I'm learning about, I didn't know what a DAO was. I had to look that up a few days ago in preparation for come into this, I'm loving what I'm reading. I'm really excited to be a part of it. I appreciate dull putting this together. I'm also just curious the way that you're presenting this,, is that I'm trying to figure out if gravity or, if all of this will be more applicable or make more sense if we're also part of another decentralized organization this would, this is my first interaction with this whole idea in general. I don't, I just wanted to, maybe if you could address that or if this something is something that can stand alone.

(00:42:31)    
**Durgadas**:    My job initially here is just to give the highest level of context. Each one of these four principles has a massive amount of really cool and very practically applicable things. Ostrom's principles, for example, is extremely useful in sorting out how to avoid things like the prisoners dilemma in your organizations, how to speak about and resolve conflicts, both interpersonally, but also in other ways, NVC can help. 

Cool thing is that each one of these things cross pollinate. The developmental thinking and non-violent communication are very related. Once you understand them the same thing with nonviolent communication and Ostrom's principles in terms of low cost, a conflict resolution, the lowest cost conflict resolution is that you educate everyone to work on conflict resolution, and then you guys can all do it yourselves without having to have a third party. 

Do you see what I mean? And so you can see that all of these have incredible amounts of relationships to each other. What I said before is if you're in a DAO, what the DAO educates is, what it becomes and what it values. If you take a look at the, any other do might be in, you can very clearly see what's their priority is by, based on what they spend their time educating. 

(00:44:04)    
**Speaker 5**:    Ahead if I'm sorry to interrupt, but I'm not a part of any other DAO like this, I can't quite tell if this is intended to be something where we're expected as gravitons to be in a DAO outside of gravity.  

--- pause ---

(00:44:20)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I can answer that. Yeah, here in the participating people, there are people from a lot of DAOs and it's great because we are kinda like spreading this message through other DAOs. If you are new to the do space, this becoming a graviton can also help you enter other DAO because you will gain like these tools, which will let you contribute in this cultural aspect of other DAO. Yeah, if right now you're not part of a DAO after becoming a graviton, for sure. You will find some community where you can like contribute. I also, one of the things that I love about gravity it's also that it is an alternative for people who is not so tech related to collaborate in DAOs because, sometimes we only think like DAOs are like for the tech guys, but it's also important to have this social aspect.  

(00:45:43)    
**Juan Carlos**:    And when you get trained in this skills any doubt that would love to implement gravity, you could like collaborate with them. Yeah. From a human side and not from only from the tech side, because yeah, and this is a distinction that I love that the TC makes and is that we have soft governance and hard governance. We have like this software governance where, things are so hard to change because they are in code and they are like a te, but that technology is put into place within a human organization. It, you can have a perfect code, but if the community that is going to deploy that code is broken the code is just going to be, yeah. Bits in the cloud.  

(00:46:48)    
**Juan Carlos**:    But the idea is to be able to empower these new institutions so that they are not only better than our regular institutions in the sharpness that they have in how much, how many transactions can they have per second, but also that we can have these institutions to be more comprehensive to human needs than the ones that we have right now. That's why it's so important to have support in a community. I cannot see myself collaborating in a community where I am only seen like as a number or as a product. , where I cannot talk to the people about maybe if I have a conflict in my life and, and feel supported because we, when we are the most productive is when we are, when we feel fulfilled, when we feel comfortable and this is also something that can help to improve the workflow of organizations, because sometimes we see that the organization is having like a roadmap and then as a conflict happens, and then everything gets screwed.  

(00:48:04)    
**Juan Carlos**:    The idea with having projects like gravity in inside DAO is that, okay, you can have a conflict that can create polarizing a scenario, but there will be people inside the community that will be working so that the community doesn't split in the first decision. Maybe if the best decision is to split, that would be something that would be like a lot put a lot of thought, but it's not like the first decision out of our rage instinct of, yeah.  

(00:48:40)    
**Durgadas**:    To answer your very specific question, this is also the first hour I ever participated in. I had no idea if I was ever gonna be able to contribute anything to this group. I'm almost famously clueless about cryptocurrency in general, but somehow, because of the nature of the cultural context that I found here, it's you'll notice it around the outside of this is radical inclusion. This idea that people can come and show up, and it's not just about conflicts. It's also about how do you actually absorb people with a really diverse set of skills into your community. That makes it inherently better as a community. Yeah, I'm a little surprised, frankly, that I'm able to participate in any real way. I've tried to participate in other DAOs, but I just keep coming back to here and I find myself lost, and I find that the costs of participating in other DAOs can be high. I continue to be included more here than perhaps in the other DAOs that I've tried to participate in. Yeah, I hope that answered your question. Thank you so much. RTU one, is it possible to ask another question? Yep. May I ask one more? Okay. Well, first of all, thank you so much for the clear introduction. It's been very enlighting. I'd like to ask a question about what your opinion is about the decentralized software on the making  

(00:50:27)    
**Speaker 6**:    For conflict resolution, such as Claro, for example, how that maybe can be in addition or maybe have another view on it. If that's, yeah. If that would also be helpful.  

(00:50:42)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I love, yeah. We to answer that question.  

(00:50:46)    
**Speaker 6**:    That  

(00:50:46)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Go ahead. It's like there are different dispute resolution mechanisms and Claro applies arbitration where the third part acts like a judge and states who the winner is in a conflict. The change we want to have is to is that we foster self C compos conflict management. That is that the outcomes of the dispute are on like our, on the parties. They depend on the parties. We, as we are more like mediators we facilitate dialogue and we facilitate that the parties like make an agreement, but we cannot enforce any solution. Yeah, that's the main difference between other dispute resolution mechanisms. Because when you have, in these traditional justice systems, you have a clear winner and a clear loser. That also states in the duality of winner losing left. Through gravity, what we want to foster is communication and dialogue, so that we can have more integrative solutions to disputes instead of one clear winner and one clear loser. Like that fosters also adversarial positions like you are my enemy, but the idea of this of gravity is to be able to stand from a non-ad adversarial point to search for common beneficial solutions for the parties.  

(00:52:34)    
**Speaker 6**:    Dialogue before arbitration.  

(00:52:38)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Like if parties don't reach an agreement through dialogue, we can scale to arbitration mechanisms like Claro, as you're saying, but this is a step so that there's no, not a clear winner or a clear loser, but rather than that, we can find better solutions through compromise. It's based a lot in, also in the prisoners dilemma. If you have few communication, you are, you're going to, or few information, you're going to take a decision that can be rushed. If we foster dialogue, what we want is to more, make the conflict more clear, to be able to see other alternatives and yeah. Through coordination search for a, for an alternative that can be beneficial for both sides and not only for one side over the other.  

(00:53:37)    
**Durgadas**:    And it's also true that you can see that this is heavily weighted toward making absolutely every effort to avoid that thing. Do what I mean? Like three out of our four things, it's incredibly detailed ways of attempting to avoid getting to that point. Obviously there are situations that people just come in game systems and create conflict or advantage things or leverage things or exploit. That's very clear. Thank you. You know? Yeah.  

(00:54:14)    
**Speaker 7**:    I would like to say a comment and to questions. If I may, we'll be very  

(00:54:19)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Quickly, please. Yes.  

(00:54:21)    
**Speaker 7**:    Thank you very much. I'm very happy to see the avatars that I already know as people. Thanks for inviting. I also am very happy to be here because I see the potential of gravity as a training for cyber physical commons prior than just for the house. This is something that may resonate with what Nick was saying at the beginning. I say cyber physical, because the gravity tone training that you are explaining here is the sheriff role or the GRA the graviton role is the sheriff role within cooperatives, which responsibilities to monitor the code of conduct. In cooperative, they lack the training and function to manage conflicts as well as the function to create, maintain, and re regenerate trust. Yeah, I been very excited to learn and apply this within competitive community that I am part of as well in other. Thanks for inviting.  

(00:55:16)    
**Durgadas**:    I have to, I have some other resources and books for you around that from the foundation for intentional community and other stuff. I'm aware of those things too. I just didn't include them here as resources.  

(00:55:31)    
**Speaker 7**:    Great. That would be awesome. Two questions. What should we expect from, are there any goals art by, for every session? I say this because it helps me a lot to know the scope of every session in goals. I know with questions to frame in my mind when learning and another thing is, will the gravity tone develop this, the gravity doubt components that you are showing us skills? Those are my, and I lost the documentation regarding the course. If you could share it again, one with me will be great.  

(00:56:19)    
**Durgadas**:    What you're referring to is gonna be in the gravity channel as far as links, and what's gonna be in each individual training. You can have a look at that. Each actually, the way we framed it was, there's some things you can watch beforehand and then there's gonna be the training and then there's some follow up from that. It's a pretty comprehensive document that includes a lot of this stuff that you're asking about.  

(00:56:51)    
**Speaker 7**:    Okay, great. Thank you. I will look at that.  

(00:56:55)    
**Durgadas**:    Okay. We're at the top of the hour, I'm willing to hang around for another few minutes, if you have further questions or anything, but if you guys have other groups to get to, then we're happy to let you go.  

(00:57:12)    
**Speaker 4**:    Can I be heard, 

(00:57:14)    
**Durgadas**:    Please?  

(00:57:18)    
**Speaker 4**:    Hey, it's was just I just wanted to say something. I heard the term earlier and I noticed it raised a flag for me. Okay. It was the term sheriff, and I just wanna like I wanna engage in this space and be open to communicating about language when it comes up. I wanna be mindful all of this work that none of us are policing. Carrying that conditioning. I just wanna like name it as I'm feeling it. That's  

(00:57:54)    
**Durgadas**:    All. That's no, that's very good. I was gonna bring that up. It, this isn't enforcement mechanism, it's in fact, it's, we've consciously chosen to not be an enforcement mechanism and to allow the individual DAOs or participants in the token engineering commons. We do have certain our own for enforcement thing, but I would say that's a bit separate from the main intention of gravity.  

(00:58:23)    
**Speaker 1**:    The, 

(00:58:23)    
**Speaker 4**:    The, I would love to say something.  

(00:58:25)    
**Durgadas**:    Yep.  

(00:58:26)    
**Speaker 4**:    Okay. Hi, this is Ryder. Thank you so much, AEs. Cuz hi, cuz my flag also went up and I just appreciate that being named it's hard to slow things down sometimes, especially with so much information. Thank you to our presenters today. I also wanna add that, I don't know who used the word sheriff, but it just really points to me. It's a reminder of living in a police environment and that we don't have, sometimes we might not have the right examples or like metaphors to use to describe what a graviton is because we don't see a lot of it in the mainstream. I just wanted to, there's no like wrongdoing there, but it's just, it's a Testament to living in a police state. I, it's interesting cause I'm in a international space and I'm an American, so I'm, I'm wondering how I speak. I'm trying to make it not to American centric, but it's also, police state probably rings true. Mosts important to person. I do see, I do see graviton training and education as an abolitionist mechanism, at least an example of it. Yeah. That's just what I stand with that they're gonna, I cut you off a bit there.  

(00:59:47)    
**Durgadas**:    Oh no, it's okay.  

(00:59:49)    
**Speaker 7**:    I just want to say something before someone else says that the flag I said about the share, but that is a different context because it's willing competitives. In the cooperatives realm, the sheriff is someone that enforces and can ban for example, the president of the cooperative, if the president signs something that is affecting the whole cooperative, because it's a corrupt decision, the sheriff can ban that signature and then immediately call the whole cooperative to a general assembly to take action into that and can bring dispute mechanisms, but they not have these regenerative trust. Maintainance that graviton was saying that's why, that's why I said, I'm really happy to have this training because it's adding to what the competitive, the environment lacks. I that's a 2.0, that's it. Well, 

(01:00:57)    
**Durgadas**:    And it's actually an interesting study for what you just said because in the context of the place where you're used to that word has a very specific definition and meaning and for aloes to bring it up and I was gonna bring it up too, was just to understand that word might have a different meaning to other people. It is from this contextualization that we're having now in this discussion that we're having now. The reason why we have three alternatives to even mediation or alternate dis dispute resolution or illegal remedies, we really go a long way and spend a long time parsing this stuff just to make it so that everyone has a shared understanding and a shared language and a shared vernacular for managing all of this stuff. The more shared that stuff is the lower cost dispute resolution is according to post from principles. On, the whole thing just rolls up and it's just benefit after benefit, trust after trust beauty after beauty that you get from caring enough to spend time and parse those things and make  

(01:02:09)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Those decisions. Also, I want to say that the graviton training is designed. Yeah, we start here. This is the first session and we are contextualizing, we are also setting expectations of what are we going to be talking about? But during the 10 sessions, we will have some core, some sessions that will be more in depth into organizational identity. We will have other sessions that we will, that will be more in depth about dispute resolution mechanisms. We will also deep dive on the gravity process. We will also have sessions about non-violent communication. Yeah the whole course we will have a course about leadership, a session about leadership. Yeah, the whole course like rounds up to have like a very general overview of what a mediator or a conflict management agent in the DAOs space could look like.  

(01:03:16)    
**Juan Carlos**:    And how through our, the processes that we are proposing, we are yeah. Giving an alternative to organizations so that they have their own justice and monitoring systems like also gravity is not that you should take what we are doing and do it as the same. I know that there are people here from different organizations and you can like iterate on this model. , we have a registry where we map and where we keep the count of the different disputes that we have addressed. I strongly feel that each organization should have their own registry. , there will, there should be at least like five people that can be visible people to, for people to request taxes, to request support. Also that there should be variety within this group. That it's not like one unilateral thinking implemented, but it's also like a collective intelligence that the develops the, 

(01:04:40)    
**Durgadas**:    And I just wanna say one other foundational thing about this and in my discovery of working on my own compassionate self, that the we're gonna, as gravitons one of the things that I'm asking you is somebody who's holding this training thing is to understand that there's a principle involved where the degree to which you extends compassion to yourself is the degree to which then you'll be able to extend it to others. This is a cultural dynamic that I'm really interested in educating and propagating it. This is part of it. It's you have to realize that there is that axiomatic thing going on there. The degree to which you have a facility with conflict resolution, and therefore you're going to fairly amazingly discover that you're going to want to proactively create trust creation within yourself. Do you see what I'm saying? And then the more trust creation you principles you create within your own life and your own mind and in your own relationships, then you're gonna then be able to extend those things out into the communities in which you participate. That's a basic Axiom that I've, I've noted in my own life. Through this process of gravity, trying to talk to you all about so that the culture can improve itself through the improvement of each of its individual members.  

(01:06:18)    
**Speaker 4**:    Can I just add something on a related this Issa here? Hi. Hi, DGA. Thank you. Thank you for this wonderful first session. I just wanted to say that I wanted to say thank you. On a related note, just to say, happy international world day of peace to everyone today. That's all, 

(01:06:44)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Thanks, SGA. I feel  

(01:06:46)    
**Durgadas**:    That's where I wore my t-shirt.  

(01:06:50)    
**Speaker 4**:    Yeah, we can't see ya.  

(01:06:52)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I feel that  

(01:06:53)    
**Juan Carlos**:    The main goal of gravity would be to contribute to building peace in the world. We see so much conflict in not only in DAOs, but in the whole world that being able to collaborate in conflict management in DAOs and also spreading the world about conflict management. It's going to be good, not only for Arabic for the organization that you represent, but also for yourself. I say this as someone who like made a major in conflict management and I, every day I practice these things and it's always easier to talk about them than to practice them. When I get mad, my girlfriend always tell me, oh, that's the conflict management that you're talking about. We are people we are not perfect. It's a lie to say that we are not going to have conflict management instead of avoiding conflict is to be able to face it and to transform it. It's a practice that is everyday practice and everyday learning. It's something that you can practice within yourself within your relationship with others within your organization. Yeah, this course is also something that can bring you like valuable things to your life.  

(01:08:18)    
**Durgadas**:    It's a living wisdom really. What you're talking about is perfectly aligned with that. Do we have any other questions or comments?  

(01:08:30)    
**Speaker 4**:    I had a, I had a, another comment I'm sorry to trail on for so long. Okay. The part of the unit that's about justice or like the resolution, it seems to put the perspective of the organization, or like what's best for the organization or the community. Almost like that's like the point of view of the graviton, or, that's the more important point of view or that's what we're negotiating for. Whereas when you have a conflict, it's more like you just have a multiplicity of perspectives. It's like an opening up of, you have individual one individual B and you have the organization, and then there's dis there's dispute because there's a different idea of, what's right. There's also a different idea of, what's just, what is justice for the individual versus the organization might actually be different.  

(01:09:38)    
**Speaker 4**:    I hope that the individual's justice is also, and maybe I'll stay. I will stay on, but I will look, I'll be looking for the, how the individuals that might, how the individuals are going to be assisted in during mediation or conflict resolution, because just solving for the organization and sewing up loose ends and deciding what's in, what's out, that might not be what's best for the individual. Then how can this other support system validate the journey of that individual, maybe by giving them extra time or resources or other like things to help them like realign or recover. It's also really difficult to be an individual engaged in a conflict. It's, it's almost like a chosen role. You are chosen because if of your difference to represent a conflict, that can be a learning moment for the organization, but it can ha it can be a heavy burden on that individual while they're engaged in the conflict to express how they've been hurt the pain they're in and what they need to repair. It's also important to not just like mediate and then enact justice, but rather find out what are the best paths for individuals and organizations and how can there be like a, how can there be a champion for the individuals as, and a support for the individuals as well as, just figuring out what's best for the organization.  

(01:11:18)    
**Durgadas**:    Yeah, of course. That's why we have so many things that sort of, what you're talking about was, is down to the principle D thing. But at the same time we have all this other stuff that would come beforehand. Principal C is about nonviolent communication is almost completely focused on the individual and providing them with that support. Right. So, and it really depends if that person's issue is related to some tragedy of the commons and that would, we would be looking at the relationship between the principal C and the principal B before we ever got to the point of having to, and I like to think that by trying to have such a complex and interwoven and interconnected, that's why I have all these different colored lines around here is because it is all very intertwined in the sense that it is the complex system. I would hope that we would not reduce any one conflict down to a zero sum game of the individual versus the organization.  

(01:12:31)    
**Juan Carlos**:    And also this is something that we feel that the reach of gravity is not like imposing any action exactly. O over a conflict, but more to deliver a set of tools that can be applied. I also strongly recommend organizations and DAO, as I was telling before that each human group has justice system. There are a lot of DAO that they don't have any justice system that they or they don't have like a policy around how are they going to manage certain situations, or they don't have like a code of conduct. That's why it's not easy to implement a conflict management mechanism in an organization that doesn't have like code of conduct. It's important for gravitons in each organization to be pushing the development of these documents that create rules and boundaries.  

(01:13:49)    
**Juan Carlos**:    And that gives sense to the interaction. Yeah, it, sometimes I, we hear, Hey, can you ate in this conflict? And when we gather more information about the conflict, we don't have any objective document from the organization saying who like who of the parts acted against the community values. Then when we don't have these documents that set the boundaries, everything is subjective. Like everyone has is right. Everyone has the reason because they are seeing it from their point of view. It's also important to have the organizational point of view to have like a set of rules of what can be the expected outcomes of a dispute. Those documents are not imposed by gravity. Each organization should have like their own code of conduct.  

(01:14:59)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Each organization should say, which actions do they promote? And which actions do they disencourage. That is not like the same equation for all, for every organization. There are more organizations like each organization can have like their own boundaries. That's why also we rely on the part of the Ostrom's principles. We are going also to deep dive in the next sessions about Ostrom's principles, because yeah, the actually the first principle is that is to have set clear boundaries and rules. How can you have like the fourth and, or the sixth principle that is conflict management without having the first principle that is clear rule rules and boundaries and yeah, it's something that you, in order to have like conflict management, you need to have like some previous steps. That's why it's not only to let's have mediators it's to have competence with within the organization and to build cultural practices that allow for conflict resolution.  

(01:16:16)    
**Durgadas**:    I will say also Jian that I participated in one group that they, the way that they've organized themselves is to say that we leave no one behind every single member of our community. We educate them and educate them and set expectations to do everything that they need for as long as they need to understand how all of this works. Then that way, when they take a decision on behalf of the group, all of the individuals are already represented by that group dynamic. Right. So, depending on how the organization is organized that one, for example, the situation you're talking about the individual versus the group, just simply can't have it in that situation. Cuz they literally, their organizing principle is we leave no one behind, there's no one who was, who is allowed to so it's really interesting. That's to see how different groups that's beautiful organize themselves. Right. You might have other people who want to have a combination of individuality and group dynamics. You see what I mean? And so the tuning of that and our participation and our advice about what the code of conduct should or would be, would change based on that internal culture. Right? This gives hopefully an example that makes sense.  

(01:17:46)    
**Speaker 4**:    It really does make sense. What both of you said makes sense is in like that set of rules can consist hopefully continuously be built upon, through, making it as robust as possible. Then like with every case study of a person, helping a person be productive in the community, you can add to that set of rules. You can add clarity, you can account for difference. It is a diff it is difficult though. When that line is established, oh, this is too much accounting for difference. Oh, I don't wanna negotiate for this much difference. That's like a place where I've seen organizations be, Hey, we'll just let people leave, you know? Right. It's, oh, it's, oh, that's sad. Then you're, sure, you're just letting people leave because you're not like allowing the organization to create a case study. You're looking at situations as fringe cases or as bad, or like something else like external. At the same  

(01:18:51)    
**Durgadas**:    Time, people have agency to be able to leave if they want to. We've, we've had situations like that in this organization where people said this is a line for me and I'm just not willing to participate at that. Right. So, and part of the reason why I put this to pink thing in here was so that you could understand that it is a generative thing and you can go around and round in this thing and people like gravity or soca or depending on whatever the context is of the working group, they all have a moderated role. They have what we've done already, which is the curated side of the picture. Then that living yes. Or what about this problem, that problem. Then very cool. Then it's just it's a, it's a, and the whole point of it. The reason why I have on the left side is living wisdom. It's, it is a thing which is alive. Right. It seems to me that is actually part of a being a graviton is to assist in the life of organizations by helping create and moderate this type of thing.  

(01:20:04)    
**Durgadas**:    In nonviolent communication, it's literally called a language of life and that's why it is one of the four cornerstones of this process so hopefully amazing helps any I'm gonna say I've, I'm gonna cut it another seven minutes. It looks like we got one more question here and I can yeah. Or comment, and then we can stop.  

(01:20:30)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I only want to say too that I really thank everyone for participating and that I look forward also to have a space, to get to know each other better. It would be great. To introduce and to get to know the group, because I see like a very diverse group and coming from different organizations and in maybe not in this moment, but in other session, it would be really great to share some experiences and to get to know more from the other side that it's like we are always standing from our side. One of the practices that we are trying to promote is to be able to stand in the other shoes and to also learn and value from the others experience as a peer and for the next week, I will be facilitating and I will be talking about conflict, transformation and theories about conflict interpretation. Yeah, I really look forward to continue seeing you the next week. I really thank you for coming for this first graviton training session.  

(01:22:07)    
**Durgadas**:    Thank you guys. I really appreciate your attention.  

(01:22:12)    
**Juan Carlos**:    Thank you very much. Goodnight.  

(01:22:14)    
**Durgadas**:    Thanks everybody. Goodbye. Thanks. Bye.  

(01:22:18)    
**Speaker 8**:    Thank you. So.
