(00:00:03)    
**Speaker 1**:    I will start recording. Once again, thanks everyone for joining. This is the sixth session of the graviton training. If you have come to all of your, of our sessions and claimed all your pops after this session, that means you will be able to be, become a graviton after the training and yeah. Continue contributing to this project and practicing all what we are training and developing. Thanks everyone. In this session we have once again, Doga and this session go about the colonization of the mind. Yeah, I will pass the mic to him.  

(00:01:00)    
**Speaker 2**:    Thanks. Welcome to number six. There's a fair bit to cover here. I could talk about this for literally three hours or four hours or five hours. I'm gonna just get started. Part of the reason we were talking about presenting was a  

(00:01:25)    
**Speaker 4**:    Good lucking.  

(00:01:31)    
**Speaker 1**:    Mutes open. Thanks.  

(00:01:41)    
**Speaker 2**:    Okay. In any case, 

(00:01:47)    
**Speaker 2**:    I'm gonna basically start with Geffin and then we'll get into decolonization in a bit. This does relate in some way to my decolonization framework, because my basic premise is that there are only two ways to think, and those are unified and divided. That if you start thinking in divided ways, then you're staying in this gray area right here between the clear and the complicated. I love this graphic because it's very entertaining, but it's also explains the typical way in which our colonized culture almost demands things to be. There's really only three places for people. There's automation, there's the known and familiar, anybody who doesn't fit into the known and familiar, we kick off into this other thing, which is one of the byproducts of for example, centralized monetary systems.  

(00:02:48)    
**Speaker 2**:    And then we rely on experts and to basically know everything and to go up this ladder and bring us some clear known and familiar stuff. So we almost have a demand level an NVC where we can't hear no to that. We can't really hear much about complexity or chaos and the people who have been in the lab coats and done the complexity are expected to create some constraints for us so that experts can understand that we can continue perpetuating this bifurcated system. I just wanted to show you this to start with, but it's a very beautiful sense making framework in the sense where you can make good decisions in terms of what it is that's going on and there are six basic things in here, four central quadrants, and then the people were getting kicked off the familiar cliff into the chaotic and the people who are confused. We'll review this again at the end of the, at the actual presentation. What I basically have done is created this framework, which I'm gonna be writing a book about actually saying from a positionality standpoint, that being a white guy, I'm the problem. Growing up in a family where I  

(00:04:26)    
**Speaker 2**:    Growing up in a family where I basically was dealing with a dad who was basically a CEO or a C level person, he was raised and educated in a culture that divided things in half. So a lot of the positionality that I come from is also, I have a hidden disability in the sense that I have autism. So a lot of times it's what I'm basically saying is that people will often listen to what I'm saying in terms of my positionality as a white guy, but I've also get to witness Juan's living in a country that's perpetually dealing with war, my wife, who's got two degrees, a gold medal in the Commonwealth games, a silver medal in the PanAm games and a bronze medal in the Olympic games does not prevent her from dealing with racism and sexism in an incredible way.  

(00:05:36)    
**Speaker 2**:    What I was, and I worked for a native band. What I was trying to do was find a way that I could understand and unify how all these different things worked. I lived in a Hindu Montessy for a number of years, and having done that spiritual work, I realized that there were really just two ways to think there are unified and divided ways to think I'm gonna recommend strongly, as you saw in the pre-work that you guys watch my stroke of insight by Joe VTE, Taylor, which talks about the two different kinds of ways of thinking. Then Ian Mogo Chris's work on the divided brain and the making the Western world is a very scholarly look at what I'm basically presenting here today. What I'm essentially doing here is talking about how we have these two different approaches.  

(00:06:27)    
**Speaker 2**:    And I do think that this has a huge effect on the token engineering side of the picture for ourselves personally has a huge societal implications. It has implication and understanding how history works and the real history, not the history that you typically learn about in school. You can see this stuff playing out, even today. In Canada, for example, we have the last oil growth rainforest getting cut down. We've got a group of people who are thinking in U in unified ways who are trying to stop the divided colonizers from doing that. My wife is heavily involved in that stuff, and they're just doing the same stuff that they've been doing for 500 years in that way. My thought was to try to unify all these things in terms of how is it that we got banking that was so centralized, why is it that we need things to be done differently? My proposal basically is that there are, you have two hemispheres, your left brain, which is the divided way of thinking and the right hemisphere, which is unified way of thinking this also go back, goes back to yoga in terms of ha and TA ha means sun TA means moon.  

(00:07:46)    
**Speaker 2**:    If you look at the social forms that we actually set up, you can actually see that in the, what we ratified in terms of the divided mind, we, 

(00:08:02)    
**Speaker 2**:    We teach really only divided things in our culture. And one of the beautiful things about being in the token engineering commons is you actually get to deal with a cultural context in which where trying to get more to the highly unified side of this picture. It used to be that you could have somebody like genus con or somebody came up with a very divided worldview, but that person would be reabsorbed into the highly unified approach that was had by most people in the world. Since colonization has occurred, that emphasis has switched now where you've got now colonizer, worldviews, dominating and unified worldviews are basically given back to pre colonization and, or they're put into the psychological shadow where we deny that there is any such thing as a unified way of approaching anything. So a lot of people actually that who show up in the token engineering commons and in my yoga center. When I'm speaking to Waka and people like this it's always, the whole thing is always about taking a look at which one of these two things are we doing in terms of that. You can see that the divided mindset will create hierarchies by default, and we're systematically destroying hierarchies and specifically decentralizing in ways that flatten hierarchies. Using whole Archies and so on. I hope this is pretty clear.  

(00:09:48)    
**Speaker 2**:    There's the two monetary systems as well. If you read the sacred economics by Eisenstein, you can see inside of the stuff that he's talking about, you can see this also inside of the stuff that Griff is saying all the time the money system is broken, what's broken about it, is that we've been validating and ratifying this divided mindset all along. You can just see it over and over again. You can see it individually in your own life. You can see it in your family life. You can see it in your, the way you're educated. Just our entire culture is basically set up as an abusive system. So the next thing really is that it actually changes the way we approach things intellectually as well. We have an educational systems focused on external objects, which are given positive value by the society.  

(00:10:50)    
**Speaker 2**:    And it basically ignores the student altogether Marshall Rosenberg, the guy who created the N NVC framework, he said he went through 12 years of postsecondary education and a regular education. He never really was asked how he felt about any of that during any of that time. That's normal and that's been normalized. What it's my basic idea that, to say that we actually, I apologize. There's one thing that I normally say in here, but I've been redoing this. I'm sorry if it's a bit lost here, just the way we socialize, even take a look at the things that are legal in our culture. If we all want to go, we all go out and have a drink, but alcohol is destructive and addictive. There are so many things like that in a socialization system where all the things that you're told that you're supposed to have a good time about these things are actually destructive, but anything that's illegal tends to be something that would break the divided, hold on the system.  

(00:12:12)    
**Speaker 2**:    And so it's, this is a useful contextualization in terms of trying to understand how this stuff works. It's also true that I took a course from Neil de law was really good. He basically is saying, what is the definition of colonization? And it's basically the shadow side or the dark side of Western modernity. The other half of Western progress, I grew up in the United States and there was this whole idea of the manifest destiny which was this idea that we were supposed to work our way across the country from east to west. But we basically didn't care at all, and we didn't ever learn anything about it in school about the domination and subjugation of other people as we went along. There's this idea of, what most people think of as colonialism is actually the transfer of people.  

(00:13:07)    
**Speaker 2**:    We just moved people into places where people already were, and this things called settler colonialism, but there's quite a lot more to it than it might appear on the surface. So I'd like to talk to you basically about this psychology, which is behind all of these things, not just the results of it, because it's also true that we are all trapped in this system. There's an awful lot of emphasis on things like mansplaining and man spreading. So there's a lot, there's a lot of things going on about the white male, but the fact is that the abuse that the white male is undergoing, they're also in denial of. The main thing that's visited upon the white male person is a denial of the fact that they're privileged in certain ways.  

(00:14:06)    
**Speaker 2**:    But the fact is that if you're oppressed in a thousand different ways, and someone says to you that you can be free of, let's say 50 of those things, then you're gonna tend to deny the other 950 so that you can reap the benefits of those 50. Then you're often then not open to the fact that other people might be experiencing the full 1000. If you're in denial of so much of what's going on. My basic assertion here is that colonization is a worldwide financial and governance level expression of narcissistic abuse. All abuse is narcissistic in terms of, and it has multiple implications, which we've seen an awful lot of in the Western media with the rise of Trump and other authoritarian figures in this fairly dystopian period of time, we're all living in, they all have very similar things.  

(00:15:11)    
**Speaker 2**:    What's neat. If you look across all of these things, you can actually see that people who are trying to recover from narcissistic abuse how I grew up as a child with my father, the way he was and people who are in abusive partnerships, people who are in cults or in education facilities, I don't know if you ever heard the song institutionalized basically gives you a nice overview of that problem. So and then if you look at the way social justice movements are set up, or even Bitcoin the perpetual disaster that's bit Bitcoin is just always gonna be wrong because it is a social justice movement. It's a decentralization. Of course, all the centralized media and everyone else is going to see this as some a threat.  

(00:16:11)    
**Speaker 2**:    Imagine a person who's decided that they were gonna be a vegan. Now, that person is suddenly a violent person. When in fact their choice of being a vegan was done so on compassionate ground. Everything is turned upside down. What I wanted to do is just have a nice examination of the root cause of all of these different things. What is it that's individually happening in the individual psychology. Then those people who are in that system of abuse are going to then tend to project that outward. You can see that social justice movements, environmentalist movements, animal rights movements, all of these things are all considered to be not compassionate movements, which is what they actually are. Rather by the centralized system, that's the divided mindset that's taking place there. The divided mindset can't really know anything about the unified mindset because that unified mindset has been placed into the psychological shadow.  

(00:17:12)    
**Speaker 2**:    And so all of the participants, when they look for validation on their unified impulses, they're gonna tend to not find them. In fact, they're gonna find things that make them scared of that. So in any case, the other thing that it's done is it's actually broken our information, ecology thinking about things in these colonized or Divi and or divided ways. And so if you actually take a look at the real history of the world, even things like anti intellectualism and American life get to this is this two factor way of thinking the unified and divided, and that the divided created colonization explains the real history of the world on so many levels. Just so I wanted to go into this.  

(00:18:14)    
**Speaker 2**:    It's also important to understand that colonization is broken up into some pieces in terms of colonization is basically the construction of these systems. For example, my participation in the token engineering comments and gravity and the comms groups are all basically because we are literally constructing systems, which if we're not careful could be colonizing systems. And then later on a hundred 50, a hundred years later, 150 years later, you can see that coloniality is something which then perpetuates the, that type of divided thinking in service of those colonized systems. When I'm talking to token engineers, when I'm talking to people about yoga, I'm talking to people about these things. I'd like people to understand how these different things work. They're very, I epistemic and ontological differences between recolonized worldviews and colonized worldviews, and post colonized or freedom oriented worldviews I believe were constructing here in the token engineering commons.  

(00:19:33)    
**Speaker 2**:    Yeah, sorry, this is mislabeled, but the, if you ignore this type of thing here at the beginning, you can see that oppression is where it starts. This is set up in terms of yoga. We're talking about yoga. People often think about things in terms of Orientalism, which is basically a way to do yoga without, including anybody from those col the cultures that created it. Right? And so if you start with oppression and then move into colonization and then other people in the, this idea of the orient, you can then culturally appropriate yoga without ever having to include those people. You can see that this is a thing which happens systematically everywhere. So this is the process of division that we experience in these colonized systems.  

(00:20:39)    
**Speaker 2**:    Talking about oppression it arises from power plus prejudice. It, actually, when you construct these systems, you tend to correct construct them in a systemic fashion. You can see that we are actually doing exactly the opposite here in terms of each one of these individual bullet points to the possibility that it could be something else entirely that we can do. We're basically doing the reverse of all of these things. Then when we're decolonizing, we basically have to recenter our epistemologies and our voices and systems. That's a thing we're, we're very much doing here disrupting, and delinking from the systemic Western Eurocentric epistemologies, and remembering and understanding the histories of those colonized people in colonialism and coloniality racism, sexism, transphobia, fear of people on the autism spectrum like myself and that thing, divesting from colonial practices and products.  

(00:22:04)    
**Speaker 2**:    This is extremely important. Repatriating, I work for a native band. We have two full-time people who work in the native band, who literally just scour the websites of museums throughout the world, trying to get back their artifacts, their tangible artifacts from museums around the world that have been taken out of Vancouver island. Undoing extraction and exclusion, that's an incredibly important aspect. The undoing, the asymmetrical power dynamic is super important because one of the things that the divided does is it sets up asymmetric system. You can see, for example, the current Facebook setup is you've got all these people who are over there basically hacking your amygdala. That's a hugely asymmetric practice. At a certain point, we ban things like subliminal advertising for a reason, but Facebook actually does a better job at that by hacking your whole reward system in your brain. Then to magnify voices who have something to teach us that have been suppressed or silenced or pushed into the psychological shadow of the whole society as a whole, and then to do reframing is also important for us individually, and to then have the courage to go into social situations, to reframe as well.  

(00:23:47)    
**Speaker 2**:    This is just an example in terms of Orientalism, but you could make many of these same arguments in terms of the financial system, the poor different things. I actually have another graphic, which I'm gonna include in here eventually. I'll show it to you guys that actually talks about the talks about how the, how they people deal with this thing it's called flick. It's actually a process for making people not be able to tell what real science is. For example, if you take a look at the flick systems, there's this fake experts, logical fallacies, impossible expectations, cherry picking, and conspiracy theories. They actually go into some detail about how all of this works in terms of how do different conspiracy theories and things happen. This is all when I say it's narcissistic abuses, because these are various forms of gas lighting and things that you see in Narcis cystic abuse systems.  

(00:25:10)    
**Speaker 2**:    In terms of Orientalism there's, these ontological and Episcopal logical dis distinctions made between whatever the targeter of the pretext of the abuse is, we're gonna go into yoga. We're gonna extrapolate the orient out of this and the oxidant and create a false binary out of that. We do all the same things in almost every situation. Race, sex, money, everything. Instead of thinking about giving money to people as a compassionate thing, we create these false binary that there's some welfare queen, which is existing driving around in a sports car, just being on welfare. There's just a whole lot of things that line up in this same exact way. There's also this idea of the good orient existed long ago in the same way that this whole make things great they used to be, but they really weren't that great back then.  

(00:26:17)    
**Speaker 2**:    And the bottom one is what I said before Westerners needing to protect against an, in an Indian pass of yoga in this case, without requiring any modern day actual Asians to exist there. You can see this again and again like on Reddit threads and things about Bitcoin and other things, the subtitle of this is called post truth. Post-race post colonization. I put that as a subtitle because it's a bit of a, it's a bit of a test really, because those things don't really exist post-truth is not a real thing. Post race is not relevant at all. Post colonizations colonization is still occurring. So one of the, one of the crucial things to know is that there's this idea of that I got from Tim wise, that he relates to specifically his work on anti-racism that actually talks about the pathology of privilege, which is that there's a blindness that existed.  

(00:27:29)    
**Speaker 2**:    There's for example, was a blindness that existed among the parents of the teenagers who did the Columbine massacres. Because they were, there were white people and they were living in a largely white situation. They didn't really, they had a privilege that made it so that they didn't have to know that there was this dark shadow thing going on, and that is a pathology. So that's why earlier I said that it's a blindness and it's my basic idea that I want to help people understand that this exists and then become aware of it and then help them get beyond it. That's the reason why I talk about this, having grown up in an narcissistic family, and I have family members still trapped in this narcissistic family. You can see that exactly this happens, let's say with the Mar monarchy of the world of the most famous of witches, the British monarchy, they extend this, but you can see that the Kennedys have a thing like this the Clintons and many others, the bushes and so on.  

(00:28:45)    
**Speaker 2**:    I'm also extending that there's this, there's this legacy to the divided way of thinking that connected to narcissism, that is a normalized expression of abuse and that we self stigmatize ourselves under the guise of these things. That we actually think that this is somehow normal. The extreme version of this it's been occurring in our society lately is just it's just a, it's just a louder version of that because we've had a very loud person give permission to a whole bunch of people. So now we have to deal with this. The thing that we don't often understand is that this existed for a long time, but not only exist for a long time, but there's an underlying psychology that came with it during the setup of all these systems.  

(00:29:40)    
**Speaker 2**:    And I like to shine a light on some of these things, the presentation that I'll give you a link to in a bit, you'll be able to go through all this. There's a ton of links and everything in here. I did want you to see that this abuse is not really, I know it's a really harsh term to use, but it's actually an appropriate one because you can actually see that we're, we have all these things going on that in terms of that's the reason why we're creating all these systems, trying to do it in a way, which is mindful of all of these things. I don't think that it's reasonable for us to look at a system for trying to resolve conflict, without understanding that we've got all this stuff sitting down in our psychological shadow, which has been so normalized, but we might not even recognize it.  

(00:30:45)    
**Speaker 2**:    And so by giving words and pointing out that these things actually do happen not only in just a relationship, but went bad between a man and a woman in a particular instance, this is actually something which is being done systematically across our entire Western modern computer using society. So here it is the, again, this is a technique for science denial, but it applies to many other things, and I'm not gonna go into this too much, but this idea of idealizing devalue and discarding is something that we see quite a lot. We all need to be aware that this stuff exists and figure out processes to undo it. For example, if I'm trying to build diversity, there's no real way to build diversity, but there are a lot of ways to build against it.  

(00:31:44)    
**Speaker 2**:    And this in many ways is a chart of exactly how these things occur. Diversity is the nature of reality. Complexity is the nature of reality. These things right here, this idealized, devalue and discard is processed by which you can undo diversity and undo complexity and prevent that from happening. It's important that we understand how these things work. Essentially what you end up with once you've gone a really far, a long way, you've start with an individual or a family, let's say the British monarchy and the British Mey goes out and conquers the world. So now you have them putting upon us their own narcissistic divided, left brain way of doing things. So now we have an entire worldview, which is infects everything from medicine to science, to everything. Essentially CIES everything. You can see that even if you're doing marketing, the idea is to actually create a cult to people who really believe in what it is that you're doing and trap you and isolate you from other ways of thinking.  

(00:33:01)    
**Speaker 2**:    Those of you around in the nineties might have heard that the PC versus Mac wars, this thing happened. I actually worked at apple and it was very much like a cult just working there. Then I said before, this pathology of privilege, and it's it, the privilege is a denial of the state of reality, the real thing. If you combine that with a social contract that says that the privilege will never be made to feel the actual consequences of their attitudes or ignorance or their bias or their actions we're seeing a ton of in the news right now, then, and you can pretty clearly see that this psychological state, this privileged state can only exist inside a systemic structure that is completely defined by abuse. So it's really something else that you guys need to think about just what a beautiful thing it is that we have a group of people, all of whom are really oriented on penetrating the outer shell of a hard shell of that bubble and the hierarchies and other divided strategum that those people use to constantly fight for a higher privilege status.  

(00:34:16)    
**Speaker 2**:    It's an incredibly challenging thing. To be so open and to deal with the fact that so many people are gonna bring in with them, this pathological division mentality that exists so pervasively in the culture. So how do we get out of this? This is this basic pedagogy of freedom is something that's this chart right here. You can chalk up to Ken Wilber's work, which I've talked about a bit before. He's a person who created basically a theory of everything called integral. It's basically consists of five parts waking up, growing up, cleaning up, opening up and showing up. Right? And so what's interesting is you can see that all the people who are in this group today and all the people who show up to all of the different meetings and get things done there's quite a lot of development in order for you to show up.  

(00:35:21)    
**Speaker 2**:    You have to get through quite a lot of other stuff. The people who show up the most are the ones who are the ones who have most thoroughly gone through this process and are showing away in their own ability to show up. A lot of times we don't, we don't give as much credit or understand the underlying processes that a person who is showing up consistently and doing things had to go through in order to be like that. I like to praise all the folks who are consistently showing up because I personally, when I see people consistently showing up for things, I'm aware that there was this huge process that they themselves had to go through in order to get there. I like this quote, just because it, this is a thing that you see a lot more in decentralized organizations. This is almost an assumption in a way that is almost subversive to the centralized mindset of both organizations and money and other things that we've come to take for granted.  

(00:36:40)    
**Speaker 2**:    When you're, when you're waking up, there's a great link here, Tara, Tim wise, interrogates the lens through which we view our social reality. It's a very beautiful thing in which I recommend you watch. It actually talks about how to regain autonomy and agency against this abuse culture. You must begin with self acceptance and compassion self-regulation self-expression and self-awareness. For all of these things, non-violent communication very beautifully gives you permission and understanding to work on each one of these things. I'd like you to also be able to see how my role in terms of being a white guy and talking about these things in society is the whole idea is one of subversion. This comes from Neil postman's work called teaching from the book. Teaching is a subversive activity.  

(00:37:47)    
**Speaker 2**:    It's very beautiful work that I would recommend everyone read. What you also, what I've noticed in my spiritual teaching is that a lot of times when people first spiritual awakening is that they wake up to this thing I've called, I've come to call the live society. Where you can see that society's been lying to you about a certain thing. Then you're, okay, now I've gotta go work on myself and I've gotta become more unified in terms of my own process. I'm just gonna keep saying it over and over. There are two different ways to think. If you can suddenly become disillusioned with these divided strategies, then you can start to get into more health.  

(00:38:39)    
**Speaker 2**:    Then you can, you have to choose your way out of the process too. Right? Part of the thing about us creating these decentralized radically inclusive systems is that we have to choose our way against this. We have to choose our way against the divided strategies and prevent those divided strategies from gaming our system, or otherwise creating problems for us. Then we also need to assert our right to understanding in terms of our own individual selves. I've put my hand up and said that I want to make sure that I'm caring for every individual person in the whole of the token engineering comments and all of the other places which I participate it's because I believe that we all need to assert our right to understand, and I wanna support your individual right. To understand. That the processes that we're creating in the token engineering comments are constructed with a view exactly toward that.  

(00:39:47)    
**Speaker 2**:    And there's another great, one of my favorite videos called the science ion by Rupert childre talks about that in terms of how we have to assert our right to understanding with respect to science. The other thing that we had in terms of some pre-work here was to talk about young Y shadow work. And so mining unconscious is really a good thing. Trying to understand what exists in there is an extremely beautiful process that not enough of us have learned how to do. That because of this, that we bring that into the organizational context in which we operate. So it's, for this reason that you might hear me recommending that we do something about that in terms of trying to get people to understand that in meetings and to talk about that. Some of the ways in which Livy and Wonka have made this happen in terms of trying to talk about ourselves during meetings can help to do that. I'd like to do that a little more explicitly over time. Now we're getting into connection a bit, which is a, which is a sense making framework that can help you overcome this confused gaslit state, which can exist often just coming out of the media landscape and the general educational landscape, and sometimes families, this link here, complexity can, and agile is really nice, especially for those of you who are software developers.  

(00:41:40)    
**Speaker 2**:    This goes back to the thing that I was talking about before, and this seems very messy, but the primary thing I want you to see out of this is that there's these words in red that determine the different kinds of action modes, which exist here. What's neat about this is a map that you can figure out what it is that you're actually doing. For example, the omega group within token engineering commons exists on the line between the chaos and the complex. Our idea with that group is to exist here and then to work our way back to create plans. We actually go across just the edge of the chaos into the complex and the complicated. You might wanna think about the different groups that you're participating in and figure out what action mode is appropriate for what it is that you're doing at this time in the, in a token engineering comments. You can actually see from a left and right standpoint, the left side in this case is the unified, the right side is the divided. And it says, even in here, when you believe all this simple everything's ordered and past success makes you in vulnerable to future failure. Think again, because before it, the chaotic domain grabs you by the throat and drags you into a crisis. We're seeing crises all over the world now in every area of human life, not just monetary systems.  

(00:43:12)    
**Speaker 2**:    And then we go into the NVC side of the picture, which basically deals with the personal, and it has larger societal and interpersonal and organizational implications, but we cover that a lot in other areas. I'd like to skip over that a bit. This really goes into a lot of detail about different things, but I did wanna just pause for a moment cuz we're in the last 15 minutes and make sure that people had a chance to ask questions and I could to some feedback.  

(00:44:03)    
**Speaker 1**:    Thanks. Thanks Dugas. Yeah, I see the full connection between this presentation and the whole of the graviton training, because we should be able to understand that right now we are still within a lot of abusive systems. With initiatives like gravity, what we try to provide is that capacity to UN undo as a symmetrical power systems. Yeah if there is an organization, we know that there are gonna be power asymmetries of different types, but we should try to treat equally all of the people that is participating in a conflict or in an issue and not objective wise, any of the positions and fight against exclusion and also to be mindful of the normalized expressions of abuse that sometimes we unconsciously reproduce. That it's important to recognize the abuse of the system that we have in order to be able to promote yeah. Better systems through the unification of different polarities.  

(00:45:58)    
**Speaker 2**:    Well, and what I like about it is that it gives me a tool in which I can interrogate all other theories. For example, if I'm looking into something in the connection side of this picture, let's just, let's just show you the newer version. Right. There's  

(00:46:23)    
**Speaker 2**:    This is the version 11 of the sort OFin model that Rob England is made. This is not as cute, but so if I'm doing a complex work and then I'm coming up with constraints, the question is have I created a governing constraint here or have I created an enabling constraint because if I've created a governing constraint, the thing that I'm moving into the complicated is something that bounds me. It binds me. So, and then later I might then create something in the model, which then I bring up into the clear and then later becomes repeatable. Now I've automated a thing that I didn't even consider whether or not I was creating a governing constraint or an enabling constraint, because if I'm creating an enabling constraint, then that means that I can't really automate that because that's gonna be a complex system.  

(00:47:21)    
**Speaker 2**:    And the very best that I can hope to do with that is to find it in an entangled state. Right? And so the best you can do in an, with an untangled state is to look at it from the complicated and the complex. You might be able to get it into the known and familiar after over a long period of time, but it's doubtful that will, there might be parts of it that you can pull out and become clear and then even fewer parts that can become repeatable. It's just super important to understand what you can and cannot do with some of these things. To understand that if you're experimenting over here in a complex, and you can create a governing constraint, you might have then just colonize that whole system, as it gets further up this energy model.  

(00:48:12)    
**Speaker 2**:    And then if you continue to do that, then you might have forgotten something. Maybe you should have created something. It was an enabling constraint instead of a governing constraint. If you do that and continue to work clockwise here, then eventually you're gonna have missed something. Then you'll kick something off of the clear, into the loss of control. Then you'll have to account for the fact that you forgot that. So that's my basic premise here is trying to make sure that people understand how what choices that you make when you're constraining things as your experimenting, and then what exactly you're modeling when you're coming from the expertise side of the picture and the complicated has a big effect. So when you're working in the token engineering columns, we're doing a lot of complex things. So most of what we should be doing is doing things that have enabling constraints, although for safety reasons, because we're working with money, we might need governing constraints, but it's important to make sure you get that there is a difference between those two things and get how you might have to revisit that at some future point, if the governing constraint that you placed that placed on a process somewhere back in antiquity stops being reasonable for that particular application.  

(00:49:41)    
**Speaker 2**:    Any other questions we don't have very much longer, but I wanted to give the opportunity.  

(00:49:54)    
**Speaker 1**:    More than a question is also to continue on the conversation. That gravitons are people should be people that is able to think in unified ways, even in difficult situations, because when we see conflict is an expression of diversity and of a divided way of understanding reality. We as graviton, when we approach a conflict, when the two people are having a divided point of view, our intention is to try to unify an understanding and to promote unified ways of solving the, and yeah, it, I see so much information in your presentation, but it's really important because we are trying to stop the reproducing, the abuse, and that's why it's so important to first identify what is the view and that's right. What you were saying that the post-truth post trace post-colonialism is a big lie because we still have see a lot of colonization in the economy and within different types. We as Gravitant should be able to fight against that colonization and provide yeah. Equality and to our systems.  

(00:51:41)    
**Speaker 2**:    And oftentimes before we can achieve that, we need to be able to orient ourselves somewhere. To know that there are contextualizing frameworks nonviolent communication alternate distribute, dispute resolution., but at the same time, there's also ways to construct trust, which is to say, to build things that subvert the possibility that a certain divided outcome could come about and if you think about it broadly enough, you can say it's important to be broad minded because it's important to be able to say, okay, I'm gonna place a governing constraint on this and see what happens, and then to be able to go tease I see now that what I should have done was create an enabling constraint here. That way I can better leverage the actual complexity that exists versus something else. So oftentimes we're, we're doing this to ourselves in a way that we're not conscious of. So it's my hope that through talking about all this stuff and giving you some examples and giving you a bunch of data and links and other things that you can go and look at that you'll be motivated to do that. To hopefully prevent future suffering future problems and to be learned to be flexible enough that we can revise the systems that we make as appropriate.  

(00:53:28)    
**Speaker 7**:    D are you, can, may I ask  

(00:53:32)    
**Speaker 2**:     

(00:53:32)    
**Speaker 7**:    Like a question, 

(00:53:33)    
**Speaker 2**:    Yeah, we got five minutes left, but I can hang out a bit longer if people are interested.  

(00:53:38)    
**Speaker 7**:    I hope I get short. Just if we recognize ourselves as still colonialized to a significant degree, even after going through this training, is it E is it fair to either side of who we would be hypothetically mediating for, to be considered a graviton, if, to what degree do we need to recognize ourselves as decolonized before we can go forward?  

(00:54:15)    
**Speaker 2**:    Well, I would say in response to that every single thing that you're looking at is an opportunity to undo the apparent duality in front of you. Right? And so in spiritual life, we say, well we ask ourselves questions. We say, am I the body? Am I this meat? S am I this food body? Am I this thing? And then through inquiry realize, what, I'm not, and then you start thinking deeper and you say am I these individual thoughts? And then you do certain practices that enable to withdraw your mind from your senses. You realize, geez, so much of my thinking was informed by the fact that I'm constantly in this relationship with the senses. So you get a different agency and autonomy over yourself in terms of that.  

(00:55:05)    
**Speaker 2**:    What I'm suggesting is that by being a graviton, you're going to be present it with a series of possible ways to resolve disputes. That you need to be able to be high minded enough, not only to resolve a dispute on behalf of someone else, but you have to first find a way to resolve that dispute within yourself so that you can then speak to it with a compassion or authority or whatever that is impactful, because you have really examined the nature of all of these cuz all of these dualities that you're gonna approach chaos or control or stability and change or these different polarities. There's a whole thing we can talk about later about polarity mapping, but all of those things are just opportunities to see a deeper and more complex version of what's going on.  

(00:56:12)    
**Speaker 2**:    For example, you're saying right now, you're, you've given yourself the very pretext of the question is I've given myself a governing constraint. Well, I can't even maybe talk to a person if I'm already colonized well, but what if you just flip that around and say, maybe that's an enabling constraint. Then this gives me the opportunity to look at the colonization that exists within myself and then overcome that. Then having overcome that and that discovery will then be fuel for you to better assist the people you're you're working with. Right? Because as a graviton, one of the things you have to do is you have to be able to put yourself in the shoes of both sides of that picture. That is automatically by definition pulling you up out of the duality in some way. So I would hope that as a graviton, when you approach a given dualistic conflict Laden position, that you could see that removal from the duality is crucial. Right. Is the, does that make sense?  

(00:57:12)    
**Speaker 7**:    Certainly. Yes, sir. Appreciate that very much.  

(00:57:15)    
**Speaker 2**:    You're welcome. Any other questions? Like I say, I'm aware that people might need to go after two minutes from now, but I'm willing to hang out for a bit longer and continue answering questions. I'll give it another 20 minutes.  

(00:57:35)    
**Speaker 1**:    I just wanted to remind people who is participating in this training, that we also have a book club on Thursdays and we are reading non-violent communication book and we are right now in chapter number five that is taking responsibility for our feelings. It's not mandatory to go, but it's very complementary and non-violent communication. It's one of a framework to promote trust and to promote compassion within ourselves. Yeah, it's just to invite everyone to those calls as well, if you're interested and yeah, thanks again, DOAs and I will open the mic yeah. For their questions.  

(00:58:33)    
**Speaker 2**:    And please do ask don't be shy. I don't right  

(00:58:44)    
**Speaker 8**:    To say thank you for the clear presentation today. For me specifically the very concrete answers within DAO within the DAO environment to actually run through this model and have it specifically seen in past situations and then DAOs would probably help me to know, be able to execute on that.  

(00:59:16)    
**Speaker 2**:    I irrelevant is always a big thing for sure.  

(00:59:23)    
**Speaker 0**:    You know?  

(00:59:34)    
**Speaker 1**:    Well, if anyone has any questions, we can start wrapping up the call and thanks everyone for joining. Yeah, if you have que any question, you can stay a bit longer for us to continue, but thanks everyone for joining this call.  

(00:59:54)    
**Speaker 2**:    And I'm currently sharing the presentation here. I opened it up to everybody with a link. Please let me know. Maybe can somebody just go there to the link and the gravity channel and confirm that to it doesn't require to request access three.  

(01:00:19)    
**Speaker 9**:    Yeah, it works  

(01:00:20)    
**Speaker 2**:    Great. Thank you.  

(01:00:28)    
**Speaker 1**:    Well, 

(01:00:29)    
**Speaker 0**:    I, 

(01:00:29)    
**Speaker 1**:    Thanks  

(01:00:30)    
**Speaker 10**:    To jump. I just wanted say that. I thought this was really extraordinary. Thank you for sharing so much.  

(01:00:38)    
**Speaker 2**:    Thank you, Tim.  

(01:00:42)    
**Speaker 1**:    Okay. See you later. You so much everyone.  

(01:00:44)    
**Speaker 2**:    Thanks. Okay. I'm still here for another 20. If you have questions.  

(01:00:50)    
**Speaker 9**:    Thank you very much. I also really enjoyed your presentation today. It was really well put together and it gave me, oh, thank  

(01:00:59)    
**Speaker 2**:    You.  

(01:00:59)    
**Speaker 9**:    I gave me a couple of aha moments myself, my friend even joined today. Oh nice. We really enjoyed it. Thank you so much.  

(01:01:08)    
**Speaker 2**:    I really appreciate any specific thing that jumped out at you or whatever you think  

(01:01:16)    
**Speaker 9**:    Just honestly, for myself, some of the cultural app appropriation, the slide that you had that started from the oppression that went all the way up to the cultural. There was just some aha moments that I had for myself for some things at time I work in advocacy and I'm a bit older and I deal with generation Z quite often. Sometimes I feel there's a bit lost from myself to that generation at times on my side of the coin, not theirs. It's important to at times I feel like I'm a lot further when you had the where it started up from waking up to growing up and all the way to guiding I believe was the last one. I do a lot of different programs in that way.  

(01:02:16)    
**Speaker 9**:    And I feel like I'm at the end, but then sometimes you have like some of these moments that bring you all the way back to step one. Sure. Waking up like another layer in the onion of your perspective of seeing something from a different way, which is exactly why I'm consistently always trying to participate in things like this, because you can never really get to the middle of the onion. Right. It's always a beautiful thing. When another perspective in somebody bringing it to you in a different way, then can let you peel off another layer of the onion to see something in a different way to be more open. Yeah, I really appreciate that.  

(01:03:01)    
**Speaker 2**:    Well, can I show you something that would speak to that?  

(01:03:04)    
**Speaker 9**:    Oh, I'd love it. Yes.  

(01:03:06)    
**Speaker 2**:    I'm famous for, I have a graphic for that. I literally have a graphic for that, 

(01:03:14)    
**Speaker 9**:    Well, I have a feeling you've got a graphic for everything.  

(01:03:18)    
**Speaker 2**:    What you're talking about here is that you can see then that you have this self and consciousness, and this is the way this is the narrative framework that I use when you're dealing with people. Right. If I was talking about it from, let's say child development, I would start with the it. Me having autism. I'm gonna develop in a certain way, there's gonna be certain strategies and things that are gonna happen as I'm developing myself and consciousness. Right. So then as I then grow up out of my base self and become family oriented and then figure out my own power and start to interact with how I want to organize myself and what I want to achieve. So on, depending on where I am in this group, which is what you were just talking about.  

(01:04:11)    
**Speaker 2**:    You're saying that there's a never ending thing about this. Well, there is actually a pretty well known developmental framework and into which you basically go, and then as you let's say, you're the achieve yourself person right now, which is most people, frankly, then you come and interact with a pluralistic system like this one, which is trying to become integral in, I believe token engineering commons is really right on the border between the green and the yellow here. Right. You're gonna be, oh, okay. There's some things in which I have to grow in order to see, do what I mean? And then what you're gonna then see is that the systems which are created by that culture and worldview then end up on this side of it and then what is produced then out the other side of those systems is something else together. Right. So there's a counterclockwise narrative that I talk about. When you say that the as you go through these different things, that's true, but at the same time, there are some well known stages in which these things occur, you  

(01:05:23)    
**Speaker 9**:    Know? Yeah. I do a 12 up trauma group. Right. Then my does Coda and that's why I had him jump in as well. So 12 up stuff and I've been doing it for like 10 years and then I do a lot of advocacy as well. Yeah. We both really enjoyed everything.  

(01:05:44)    
**Speaker 2**:    Thank you so much again, I'm still eager to hear other questions or comments. I know there's some people in here. I know anything you didn't like about it, something that rubbed you the wrong way. Maybe  

(01:06:24)    
**Speaker 9**:    I wanted more.  

(01:06:27)    
**Speaker 2**:    Well, I have, that's literally why I'm writing a book about it. Cuz I got to 60 pages of my presentation. Some of those pages are very dense and contain a lot of information. Yeah, I it's really nice to have a unified framework in which you can understand the operation of society, cuz it's very despairing to have all these crazy things happen and then not have something into which you can ha have a narrative that makes sense and is congruent and I found myself really wanting that, especially in the last five or six or seven years it's been, it's been very, I don't know that I would've survived the landscape of the last few years without having some way at which to understand all of this, you know? And so that's what  

(01:07:24)    
**Speaker 9**:    Trying get  

(01:07:25)    
**Speaker 2**:    To, 

(01:07:26)    
**Speaker 9**:    I know a lot about narcissistic personality disorder. I said about just mental health illiteracy in general, so  

(01:07:36)    
**Speaker 2**:    Well, and that people just don't understand the construction of these things. The fact that we live in this asymmetric colonized system that is using colonial to per perpetuate these unequal systems that everyone is suffering from. Right. So that's why I don't like to break it up into this white guy, black guy thing, even though I'm a white guy and it might sound like I'm trying to avoid something around that. That's not it at all. I just didn't think it was diagnostically accurate. What I mean? I just felt like there needed to be some way to understand why all of us are here. Right? Why all of us tolerate this system? Why is it that everyone manages all this right. In some way. So this is my attempt to unify things and I'm, I don't know that it'll ever be done revising it because I'm always gonna have something to learn, but I really did try to consult with as many people as possible from the native band.  

(01:08:45)    
**Speaker 2**:    And it was all taken as a, my whole process is one of subversion. If you look at real spirituality, that's a process of subverting your identity so that you can see the world the way that it really is. Many of the problems that we have in our society are based in this a false identity, that's perpetuated upon us by divided thinkers. Right. You, once you see it, that it's really hard to unsee it, you know? And so it's nice. When I read a thing. I can read that with the thinking of unified and divide it. If I read Charles Eisenstein sacred economics, I can see that's there. If I read different leadership books, different people trying to come up with different solutions for the different problems that plague society in different ways, all of that is combination of unified and divided thinking.  

(01:09:44)    
**Speaker 2**:    But unless you understand the context of it in this larger way and can identify the specific ways in which the divided thinkers work and the unified thinkers work, then you might be creating a system that just perpetuates a different type of coloniality. It's super important that we have tools to work against that. It takes an awful lot of education and individual coaching and deal with things. That's why I'm here. It's the whole reason I participated in this community is to try to further that thinking. I don't find too many communities in which people are open to that much less actively wanting that to occur. So this is basically one of those, 

(01:10:39)    
**Speaker 12**:    I appreciated DDoS, how you incorporated the sacred economics ideas, because the last time I saw one of your presentations using some of this stuff, that was really interesting to see Eisenstein's secret economics presented in this DAO or a token space, because it builds upon this idea of, what are the different constraints that exist? And then also, how do we look at Mon money or monetary  

(01:11:12)    
**Speaker 2**:    Systems from a really human way as opposed to this abstract thing that removes any soul from it? Yeah. Decontextualization is the tool of the colonizer. That's the, and contextualization and the pedagogy for contextualization is education. The pedagogy four decontextualization is ignorance. You can actually see all of Eisenstein's recommendations are based in these fundamental motivations. What's wrong with the picture? What can we do about that? Just comes down to those two things. Right. So it's so when I read things, that's what I'm saying. It's a lens through which I can interrogate all these other things. It gives me a way to, it's just, I'm just a super, I need contextualization because my brain thinks about things. So broadly now that I can't take any deco contextualized fact as an individual piece. It just doesn't sit well with me. Then we've been taught to do exactly that in our society. I like to encourage coach present different ways to try to get beyond that. I love to read all these different books about potential solutions like Eisenstein and witnessing everyone here. Who's putting their money where their mouth is literally to do exactly. That is very beautiful thing.  

(01:12:52)    
**Speaker 1**:    Thank you. I didn't know about sacred economics, but I will read it. Also the other thing that I was thinking is that the good thing of going into the unified is that we can do checks and balances and last week community call or two weeks ago, we had this project called century. That made me think a lot because it's a project that gives, try to give, try to give more value to a tree that is planted than a tree that is caught to be processed. Yeah, it's somehow a way that we can do checks and balances and promote economy activities that promote the unified yeah. Unified economy. That's the main problem of our economy that it only measures financial value and in a framework of what is that a thing worth for in our economic system, but not, it actually takes the whole meaning of the thing being part of our ecosystem or of part of our nature.  

(01:14:49)    
**Speaker 2**:    And it's actually, 

(01:14:53)    
**Speaker 2**:    It's life and anti-life right. What you're describing I like NVC, because it's saying that it's a language of life. Right. It, I like to think that a well done economic system could be the economics of life. Right. You could spirituality, the spirituality is literally, how do you think in more increasingly unified ways. How do you contextualize make sense of, and make relevant the divided stuff? Because it's a divided stuff isn't to be thrown out either. It's not all evil. It's that when it's done in an imbalanced fashion, that is creates a problem for you. Right. So to create a balance between the unified thinking and the divided thinking, we all still exist as apparently individual humans. If you treat yourself as though you're not just an individual then, and then you'll then extend that same thing to others. That's a basic psychological precept. Okay. Three more minutes. Let's say one more question. I'm mean, I just ask Nate or Lauren who are the people I know best in left in this group?  

(01:16:23)    
**Speaker 15**:    No, you've done a great job, man. I really do appreciate you. Me presenting today.  

(01:16:28)    
**Speaker 2**:    Thank you.  

(01:16:32)    
**Speaker 16**:    Me too. I'm just hanging out, listening, cuz I feel like it was like just a lot of, just a lot of information a lot to take in, and even with the slides, I'm excited for you to share the presentation. Cause I feel like there's so much information on the slides I wanna like  

(01:16:46)    
**Speaker 2**:    It is in there. Yeah, 

(01:16:48)    
**Speaker 16**:     

(01:16:49)    
**Speaker 2**:    I included it and thanks for, to Tiffany for putting in the link to the sacred economics, which is online. I will, I should have included that in my presentation, but presentation is constantly in flux, so  

(01:17:08)    
**Speaker 14**:     

(01:17:10)    
**Speaker 1**:    Well everyone, thank you. Thanks. Thanks. Doga as for facilitating this session and we hope to see you yeah. In next in further meetings.  

(01:17:21)    
**Speaker 2**:    Okay. Thank you.  

(01:17:22)    
**Speaker 1**:    Okay. See you everyone. Thanks.  

(01:17:25)    
**Speaker 17**:    Bye. Thank you. Bye everyone.
