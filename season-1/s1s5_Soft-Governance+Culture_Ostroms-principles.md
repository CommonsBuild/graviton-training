### [Soft Gov & Culture](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sykUfttLkZm_zoZqlM1nqpdvF1tpmgnK8CrhLHUahRY/edit#slide=id.ga98e825200_0_50) - Liviade

### Three Influential Models

* **Tragedy of the Commons** 
  > “What is common to the greatest number has the least care bestowed upon it” 
  > 
  > “Wealth that is free for all is valued by no one, because he who is foolhardy enough to wait for its proper time of use will only find that it has been taken by another” 

1. we are so far from the decision making that it becomes abstract
2. I have no access or understanding to the provision of the resources, therefore I identify with its scarcity 

* **Prisoner's Dilemma** 
  > “In a prisoner's dilemma game, each player has a dominant strategy in the sense that the player is always better off choosing this strategy, no matter what the other player chooses.”
  > 
  > “The paradox that individually rational strategies lead to collectively irrational outcomes seems to challenge a fundamental faith that rational human beings can achieve rational results.” 

1. Cooperating beyond rational choices - ratio, quantitative 
2. adding qualitative variable
3. rationality often excludes very important variables of the human behavior. Big problem of the theory and its practical implementation 

* **The Logic of Collective Action** 
  > “One who cannot be excluded from obtaining the benefits of a collective good once the good is produced has little incentive to contribute voluntarily to the provision of that good” 
  > 
  > “Olson considers it an open question whether intermediate-size groups will or will not voluntarily provide collective benefits. His definition of it depends not on the number of actors involved but on how noticeable each persons actions are.” 

1. The free rider problem 
2. the subjective value of a hitchhiker 
3. transparency not only to monitor, but to be seen.

### 8 Principles for Governing the Commons 

1. Clearly defined boundaries
2. Congruence between appropriation and provision
3. Collective choice arrangements
4. Monitoring 
5. Graduated sanctions
6. Conflict resolution mechanisms
7. Minimal recognition of rights to organize
8. Nested enterprises 

### Forgiving Rules

> “If individuals make honest mistakes or face personal problems that occasionally prevent them from following a rule do not have access to mechanisms that will allow them to make up for their lack of performance in an acceptable way, rules may come to be viewed as unfair, and conformance rates may decline.”

> “The way in which rules are enforced is forgiving of occasional lapses and errors and allows appropriators to avoid the high costs that can result from rigid application of uniform rules in a changing and uncertain environment”

### Monitoring

> “When the rules in use conform to the design principles discussed in chapter 3 (enabling individuals to design rules that will keep monitoring costs low) and individuals adopt contingent strategies, individuals are also motivated to monitor each other to obtain the information they need to pursue this contingent strategy.” 

> “If individuals begin monitoring others and learn that others comply most of the time with a set of rules, they are more likely to be willing to adopt and/or continue contingent strategies.” 

### Small acting workshop

* *Acting* is a practice of empathy. You are preparing to welcome someone without judgement. 
* There are tools to understand the other.
* Exercises of how can i walk on the other person's shoes.
* Bringing *sensibility* to the body, lets you listen to your emotions.
* Self understanding as a window to the other.

### What is the need that soft gov addresses in the TEC 

* *Manage* behavior challenges
* How we need to deconstruct / break down assumptions
* *Overcoming* certain cultural backgrounds
* Accepting different cultural constructions, *questioning* ways of operating
* Understanding differences *->* roots of human nature
* We are all finding it out *together*, that is the bond.
* Unlearning to learn again.

**b) [Rebuilding Companies as Communities](https://hbr.org/2009/07/rebuilding-companies-as-communities)**

> Beneath the current economic crisis lies another crisis of far greater proportions: the depreciation in companies of community—people’s sense of belonging to and caring for something larger than themselves. Decades of short-term management, in the United States especially, have inflated the importance of CEOs and reduced others in the corporation to fungible commodities—human resources to be “downsized” at the drop of a share price. The result: mindless, reckless behavior that has brought the global economy to its knees.
> 
> Government stimulus programs and the rescue of the biggest and sickest corporations will not alone resolve the problem. Companies need to reengage their people. The practice of both management and leadership needs to be rethought.

### Ostrom - Governing the Commons

> “The imposition of some sanctions reassures the rule-breakers that deviations by others are also likely to be discovered. Rules are forgiving of occasional lapses or errors and allows appropria­tors to avoid the high costs that can result from rigid application of uniform rules in a changing and uncertain environment.”

*We have rules to forgive lapses and errors*\
*We have graduated sanctions to correct and redeem*

**c) [Ostrom, Governing the Commons](https://wtf.tw/ref/ostrom_1990.pdf)**

> In this pioneering book Elinor Ostrom tackles one of the most enduring and contentious questions of positive political economy, whether and how the exploration of common-pool resources can be organized in a way that avoids both excessive consumption and administrative cost. 
>
> These cases, where a resource is held in common by many individuals - that is, well­ defined individual property rights over the resource are absent - are often held by economists to be exploitable only where the problem of over­ consumption is solved by privatization or enforcement imposed by outside force. 
> 
> Ostrom, by contrast, argues forcefully that other solutions exist, and that stable institutions of self-government can be created if certain prob­lems of supply, credibility, and monitoring are solved. She provides a close study of a uniquely broad range of cases, including high mountain mead­ ows in Japan and Switzerland, water projects in the Philippines and Cali­fornia, and fisheries in Canada and Turkey. Some of these cases involve stable institutions; in other cases the institutions were fragile and failed. 
> 
> Basing her conclusions on comparisons of sources of success and failure in self-government, **Ostrom describes some fundamental characteristics of successful common-pool management schemes**, and concludes with a chal­lenge to other social scientists to build on her original theoretical work.

> This paper outlines the “tragedy of the commons,” reviews Nobel Prize Winner Elinor Ostrom’s
principles for sustainable governance of common-pool resources (CPR), and relates both to outer space. Ostrom’s principles were distilled from decades of studies on dozens of CPR situations. They capture the best practices of CPRs that have been used sustainably for decades or even centuries, thus avoiding the famous “tragedy of the commons” without relying on privatization or a “Leviathan” authority. When viewed in the context of space sustainability and governance, these principles highlight some long-standing challenges and emerging issues. Over the past few years, achieving the long-term sustainability of space activities has become a central goal for many, both at the national and international level.
> 
> However, while more policymakers and stakeholders are recognizing the importance of space sustainability, none have spelled out an effective governance strategy, and accompanying policies, for accomplishing it. This paper concludes that Ostrom’s principles can potentially inform those ongoing policy initiatives and highlight specific areas on which to focus initial space sustainability efforts.

### Deontic principles for rules 

> “Institutional rules are prescriptive statements that forbid, require, or permit some action or outcome (E. Ostrom 1986a). One of the three deontic operators - forbid, require, permit - must be contained in a statement for it to be considered a rule.” P.139

### Institutional Change

> “Both origins and changes in institutions can be analyzed using the same theory when both are viewed as alterations of at least one status quo rule.” P.140

### Ostrom’s principles for enduring CPR institutions

1. **Clearly defined boundaries** - Individuals or households who have rights to withdraw resource units from the CPR must be dearly defined, as must the boundaries of the CPR itself.
2. **Congruence between appropriation and provision rules and local conditions** - Appropriation rules restricting time, place, technology, and/or quantity of resource units are related to local conditions and to provision rules requiring labor, material, and/or money.
3. **Collective-choice arrangements** - Most individuals affected by the operational rules can participate in modifying the operational rules.
4. **Monitoring** - Monitors, who actively audit CPR conditions and appropriator behavior, are accountable to the appropriators or are the appropriators themselves.
5. **Graduated sanctions** - Appropriators who violate operational rules are likely to be assessed graduated sanctions (depending on the seriousness and context of the offense) by other appropriators, by officials accountable to these appropriators, or by both.
6. **Conflict-resolution mechanisms** - Appropriators and their officials have rapid access to low·cost local arenas to resolve conflicts among appropriators or between appropriators and officials.
7. **Minimal recognition of rights to organize** - The rights of appropriators to devise their own institutions arc not challenged by external governmental authorities.
8. **Nested enterprises** - Appropriation. provision. monitoring, enforcement. conflict resolution, and governance activities are organized In multiple layers of nested enterprises.

### Questions:

1. What is the importance of having a strong cultural build in DAOs?
2. What are the similarities between CPRs and DAOs?
3. What are some of the principles for enduring CPR institutions, according to E. Ostrom?
