## [First Graviton Training Study Plan](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/first-graviton-training/217) - Notes

**a) [Understanding the impact of role plays & simulations for conflict management](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SNiGTwJFb_z4XL4K3Ice5Atnyg68Izjp/view?usp=sharing)**
  > Many educational theorists believe that learning is context-dependent. In other words, the nature of a student’s learning depends on the context in which the learning takes place. From this perspective, authentic activities—or learning activities that re-create as closely as possible the key dynamics and challenges of real-world activities—are critical to making learning relevant.
  >
  > But what does it mean to make a negotiation exercise “authentic”? One approach is to select exercises in which the parties, issues, and factual contexts replicate as closely as possible the negotiations with which participants are familiar. This is most easily done with a relatively homogenous participant group-for instance, litigation attorneys, middle-school teachers, environmental activists, financial services sales representatives, or congressional representatives—who are likely to share some common negotiation experiences.\
**b) [How exercises, cases and coaching can make you a better negotiator](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X5lvtT3ha-wvq-JVlfUJJmRn0EZQUrdE/view?usp=sharing)**
  > In the January 2013 issue of Negotiation Journal, George Mason University professor Daniel Druckman and Creighton University Law School professor Noam Ebner discuss the benefits and drawbacks of simulations as a learning tool. Reviewing social science research, they find that engaging in simulations improves students’ motivation and retention of key concepts that have already been taught in lectures and classroom discussions. Thus, classes that combine simulations with more traditional classroom methods may maximize learning.\

  > While no communication medium is as rich in social cues as face-to-face meetings, some are richer than others. On the phone, we can read a lot into our counterpart’s tone of voice and how quickly they get down to business. On a video conference, we can assess the other party’s receptiveness to a proposal from their smile or, conversely, their crossed arms and frown. Emails and texts tend to be “impoverished” forms of communication because they lack nonverbal and visual cues, though emojis can help.
  > 
  > Communication media also vary in their synchronicity, or the degree to which people can be engaged in the same activity at the same time. Phone calls, conference calls, and videoconferences—and, to some extent, text messages—allow us to carry on a continuous conversation. By contrast, emails (and sometimes texts) tend to extend the communication process because of delays between messages, note Swaab and Galinsky.\
**d) (video) [Teaching Simulations Online: Q&A with David Seibel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCvLpiRWiqw)**
  > PON Affiliated Faculty member, and experienced online negotiation teacher, David Seibel presents tips and tricks for teaching with role-play simulations online.\
**e) [Dana Caspersen’s 17 principles of conflict resolution Summary](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201501/17-rules-guide-you-through-any-conflict)**
  > Conflicts trigger our deepest emotions. Just watch two young children battle over the same toy. Filled with sheer rage, they each grab at the toy, and each other, until one of them prevails (or the toy breaks).  Such conflicts set the stage for all of our adult struggles. The words we use may become more sophisticated, but the underlying feelings remain strikingly similar.
  > 
  > The key feature of the new Dana Caspersen’s book, [Changing the Conversation: The 17 Principles of Conflict Resolution](https://danacaspersen.com/book/), in my opinion, is its emphasis on these underlying emotions. This graphically-oriented how-to book takes the reader through her 17 principles in a way that allows you to understand each principle, its “anti-principle,” its focus, specific examples, a way to put it into practice, and the choice it presents.  Drawing from examples that range from relationships to office politics to parenting, Caspersen gives you the chance to understand what’s behind life’s everyday conflicts and how best, in turn, to consider handling them.

The group will be divided into pairs. choosing one of the following cases:

* *PowerScreen Case* (High complexity) 
  - (Video) [The HackerStar Negotiation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JID9RAIYe34)
    > A realistic video depicting the use of principled negotiation to prepare for and negotiate a bitter business dispute. Features Getting to YES co-author Roger Fisher. 
    > 
    > The HackerStar video is based on the PowerScreen Negotiation Role-Play Simulation, and can be used alongside the simulation. Both the video and role-play are available from the [Teaching Negotiation Resource Center](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/store/)
* *ParkerGibson Case* (low complexity) 
  - [Real Estate Role-Play: Parker-Gibson](https://www.pon.harvard.edu/shop/parker-gibson/)
    > Two-party, single-issue distributive negotiation between two neighbors regarding the potential sale of a vacant lot; refinement of Appleton-Baker
