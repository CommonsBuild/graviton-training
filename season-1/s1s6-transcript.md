# Season 1 Session 6

(00:00:00)
**Speaker 0**:    Session are going to be about a deep dive on the conflict management platform that gravity is building. And also what are the, the, the requirements for gravity. And also it's very important for gravity to understand the code of conduct that we are going to be framed by the last session with levy, we were talking about the, the importance of boundaries of rules and boundaries, and following the application OFS principles, we have decided to, to take care of our rules and boundaries, and like think on them to, to, to looking for the, for, for the wellbeing of the community. So the, this code of conduct is a really important document that I think that the gravitons should be familiar with because instead of, of defending points of view, we can refer to the code of conduct as a source of legitimacy. And we can say that the, the behavior is not well taken because I say so as, as a  

(00:01:54)
**Speaker 0**:    Is right now, moving this work that we have done in a to read, but I want to present you what, what we are doing and what we are, what, what are going to be the rules and boundaries that that will give shape to, to on the code of conduct. Then we are going to talk about the participation of Rav in community management. And then we will go a little bit on, on the forum post that, that has been made in the forum on, on the GRA gravity on gravity to also understand like, where are the, the, where the work that we have been doing and of, of how are gravitons going to like work. But I, I hope that between this session around the process and around the steps can be, this is, I, me, I always love to start with a meme and really that we are trying to bring here into, into, into addition our way to frame behavior and to, to set some rules for, for, for every of the members.  

(00:03:56)
**Speaker 0**:    So the TC, we have a value aligned code of conduct. The TC operates from a prosocial that the principles that guide the TC. So it's also very important for other communities to try to frame their themselves between principles and not between like, yeah, not between a, a criteria or a judgment made by, by a group of people, but like by, by some principles that, that are not associated to a group of people, but to, to the values that of, of, of the organization goods over profit profit is not bad on the country. It is critical towards our goal of creating economy that support the token in the engineering community, but providing services to support the te community is more important than making a profit. And also we are human centered. We encourage initiatives that are and strive to only create positive impact.  

(00:05:28)
**Speaker 0**:    We hold ourselves to high standards of safety, resilience, and express their opinions and contributions free from any malicious reaction resilience. We ask members of this community to communicate openly and to make an effort to maintain if conflict arises. We expect members to like peacefully towards a resolution and the restoration of harmony and efficiency. Okay, this is something that I, and I should have taken it, but okay, integrity, honesty and consistency lead to trust, which is a core value of healthy communities. Our approach, our approach is to trust first and any instance of scam mislead spa, or the fraud will be treated as a violation of this code of conduct. We encourage our members to be incentives, especially if there are no conflicts engineering projects, organized action towards designing, sustain crypto systems.  

(00:08:39)
**Speaker 0**:    So why did I take the time to read all these? Because sometimes we like forget our values, and it's very important to understand that here is not like what one person says is that we, we have these values and in, within our values, we, we are talking about, about accepting the difference about respecting each other about being value driven about being a human centered. So these are like the, the, the basis and the, and the basic understanding that we are going to try to, to reproduce in, in every interaction of, of the TC. That's why it's really important for, gravitons not only to understand these values, but also to replicate them and to behave according to them in, in, in their, in their role of, of that, that, that is very aligned and very associated to community management. The, the role of, of easing communication is, is also very related to the community management.  

(00:10:03)
**Speaker 0**:    And that is why I am really happy to say that the new discord that we are going to migrate to is going to be moderated by gravity and by graviton, and also with the, with the help of transparency. So it's, it's very important that the, that the members of, of these groups are also a reflection. And also that they lead with the example of, of acting according to these values, because it wouldn't have any sense to have graviton that don't follow the, the, the code of conduct of the organization, instead of that, to be a graviton, we, we will have additional requirement different to the, to the, to the requirements of the normal members in the organization. So what are the additional requirements that we have in the gravity code of conduct?  

(00:11:13)
**Speaker 0**:    We decided to make this approximation to a code of conduct for, for the different platforms that we use and the different working groups using, what, what Ostrom says that is that sometimes we don't include what is required when we are making rules. And we only make rules thinking on what is allowed and what is forbidden. But here we, we tried also to add an important thing of what is required to join and stay in the collective. So what actions can be taking in, in, in gravity, everyone in the community can fill the gravity type form or approach any of the gravity to request support for conflict and any sort of support or on the side situations. In case of conflict, gravitons can approach the parties involved to collect information on the issues. Graviton can take actions to regulate unwanted behavior. According to the graduated sanctions, all community members can propose new methodologies to approach graduated sanctions and mutual monitoring, as well as a great current ones. Through advice, process and forum voting gravity can submit conflicts or issues to the gravity registry. That is a database of the case managed by gravity conflict resolution calls and chats are closed to gravity and parties involved to respect privacy and vulnerability. The gravity working group can host trainings and capacitating individuals to become gravity. The gravity training is free and open for all. Gravity can remove proposals from all the voting categories, if they receive flaggings and, or are seen as harmful for the community, based on our rules, boundaries terms, and conditions and code of conduct.  

(00:13:23)
**Speaker 0**:    And now what are the requirements and what is like discouraged or forbidden? The requirements are that all members should act in acknowledgement of the guidelines for a scale of conflict and graduated sanctions that will go over them in a moment, graviton should comply to the code of conduct to of the TC and the additional graviton code of conduct graviton should accept case cases based on their competence and communicate to the gravity working group. If they don't feel capable of having an issue, graviton should promote trust and good relationship between the community. It is required to complete. The graviton will update the gravity registry with the information of possible agreement. All members should commit to respect the protocol for TC calls and respect the arrangements made about the situations issued. So the, these are like the rules that we are going to follow in in gravity.  

(00:14:34)
**Speaker 0**:    Like, you know, we all are making this training to become a Gravitant and there is no, no one that can, that can become a Gravitant without being in this, in this training. And after we, our gravitons, I, I, I think that we will need some, some like new roadmap to, to integrate some of, of the new ideas that graviton that, that you can can have for improving this trading and for improving this program. And the idea of all that is that when we have this organization made, we can then go out and offer our services to other organizations.  

(00:15:29)
**Speaker 0**:    So what is discouraged in for, for, for, for gravity using confidential gravity information to serve personal interest that will lead Toulon of the gravity group, and because any member can monitor gravity actions and report to other gravity feel in the type form or contact community steroids, and like the gravitons as all of the members of the organization are engaged in this mutual monitoring. So gravitons can, can also be, be reported to another graviton or, or to be at a type form or contacting another community steward for, for telling some behavior or unwanted behavior that the, that the gravity is reproducing or, or any conflict that may involve a gravity.  

(00:16:39)
**Speaker 0**:    And as I, as I was saying before, it is really good that now gravity has a moderation ours in this new, because that will help us to respect the protocol of the TC meetings. It it's, it's very important that we have like clear rules so that anyone is, is, is, is lost, or that if anyone is new to the community, they can, they can like get engaged where we behave the community. Because here we have to take in, in, in mind that this is a, like our, our workplace, and there are, are certain boundaries on what can be published in, in the, in the, in the discord. And also there are certain boundaries of what can we do in our, in, in, in a call because most of our calls are being recorded and streamed. So it's very important that we keep order in our calls. And that is why we have a protocol for, for, for the teeth, because,  

(00:18:04)
**Speaker 1**:    But  

(00:18:04)
**Speaker 0**:    If a five  

(00:18:08)
**Speaker 1**:    Like  

(00:18:09)
**Speaker 0**:    Goes in, in, in a call, maybe that, that would affect the whole community.  

(00:18:16)
**Speaker 1**:    And it's good that,  

(00:18:19)
**Speaker 0**:    That  

(00:18:20)
**Speaker 1**:    We're to, to  

(00:18:23)
**Speaker 0**:    Turn any mic, if, if like the, the tone of the discussion is, is going too strong, or even if open mics are an open mic, it's, it's good for the, for the, for the gravitons or for the moderators to be able to server mute someone to, to looking for, for the quality of the call and quality of the sound. And these are like the ground rules for the interactions that we have in polls. We have non-violent communication is the common rule and grateful to our members to, and to our co colleagues. That's why we give praise. And it, it it's good always to respect. And we don't like using any like nicknames or something like that. We it's always good to ask someone, how do you like to be called just like starting with this, with this small, to, to have a good, a good first step to start communicating with the other. And we promote humbleness of knowledge because here in these communities, we all are experts. And we all are very competent people that has a lot of knowledge and a, a lot of wisdom in them. So instead of trying to impose our own perspective into the, into the community, we will, what we want is to enrich the community with the diversity of knowledge that we all can bring  

(00:20:17)
**Speaker 0**:    Into and do what they are, what they  

(00:20:33)
**Speaker 1**:    Feel or  

(00:22:14)
**Speaker 0**:    Calls. So the idea is not to spend time in calls, like on topics that are not for the purpose of that call. If we want to have, if we want to discuss something, it's good to like schedule a other members work, we have to respect others and integrity. And this is a like very aligned to what we are trying to say of, of valuing everyone as, as, as, and respecting the dignity of each member. And these are also rules related to, to the community management in the different, in the different platforms and like spamming and sabotage leads to retire from the call. And if this is happening in a, in a repetitive way, the, the user may be retired from the server.  

(00:23:20)
**Speaker 0**:    And this is another thing that is encouraged is that as, as we are a community from, with people from all over the world, sometimes we can feel more comfortable expressing certain ideas in, in, in our native language. So even though that we communicate in English for like our main language to communicate, if, if there is a word or an expression that I don't know how to, how to say in English, maybe I, I, I can use and, and talk in Spanish and other member can help me to, to express because the idea that even though that we have language barriers here, we, we can ease the communication for everyone.  

(00:24:16)
**Speaker 0**:    So here is, is also going deeper into gravity participation in community management, and is that THEC has its own tailored rules and boundaries, which are co-created and translated into protocols, processes, and guidelines that are made to follow our values, take care of our systems and regulate autonomously. We are. And in gravity, we are proposing a mutual monitoring system with, or, or with a direct communication to the following responsibility as a need, as individuals to promote dialogue within the organization of sanctions and both a collective and individuals to in our community practice. So what is our goal? The goal of gravity is that people in the community recognize the agreements and culturally act coherently with the values of the organization. And if there is conflict, there are clear steps to follow in order to manage the situation for defected search and implementation of solutions that respect the dignity of all parts involved.  

(00:25:45)
**Speaker 0**:    It's very important to understand that this is something that, that are able to make, to offer ways to solve some of the thought by the activities that, that we are involved in, because we are involved in coordination activities. We are involved in, in, in decision making activities we are in involved in it's, it's very important. So that, that, that we, we have clear steps to follow up, to, to manage the situations that may arise in this coordination, in this decision making in this research that we are, that we are making, because like conflict, as we have seen in, in past sessions is a natural possibility in life. So we should be able to understand the, the, the possible conflicts that may arise within the activities that we are involved in and within the media that we, that we communicate through. So that, so that then we can suggest actions for, for, for improving or for correcting that, that unwanted behavior.  

(00:27:32)
**Speaker 0**:    So the gravity group aims to work the group aims to support the TC by actively promoting trust setting expectations and managing conflict between individuals, the different groups and the community as a whole recognize boundaries and areas of potential dispute, as well as explicit violations of boundaries between individual and the community as a whole supporting communication between community members and encouraging participation at all levels individually in groups and inside the communi as a whole hold admin powers to manage systems of communication on behalf of the co groups and as a promote by pro proactively boundaries discussions and exchange in a system of shared, and as a group take decisions regarding the implementation of, and commit to its participation with respect to all individuals, especially ones that don't follow and understand. Yeah, the idea instead of that, is that contract that don't follow our conditions can be correct it in, in order to, to prepare the harm done and, and think the same way that we do with respect and with value of their dignity. We, we, it would be on coherence that we would make that what idea, what we are doing is to, to  

(00:29:58)
**Speaker 0**:    Session that he, he, she said about the, how rules can be also for forgiving rules. And that, that we are trying to apply within the organization are not like punishing rules in the next session. I want to go like really in the detail of what our, what our suggested graduate sanctions, but most of them are, are not any punishment. Most of them involve like, love, like swarming with love, like that is a sanction instead of, of, of having to pay a due or something a sanction can be to, to, or, or an action, a, a reasonable action for that to manage that conflict can be like swarm that, that person with love or trying, trying to engage him or her in other activities that, that may, that may make her, or him feel more valued. Or, yeah, the sanctions that we are proposing are very, like from the point of view of reconciliation and healing.  

(00:31:21)
**Speaker 0**:    So here is the guide for, of conflict and S and for studying the conflict, serves us to suggest appropriate actions, to correct the unwanted behavior and a list of, of, of, of ingredient, a list of ingredients to identify when a conflict is in a mid scale conflict, trying to propose certain actions for, for each scale of sanctions guideline. So you can see that the, the, the, the actions are, are like follow up. Most of the time nothing happens can be settled with, and this is like a signature that I am to, to make. And is that after every dispute, we could, we can make a small reconciliation between the parts where both of them can like forgive themselves and forgive the other, say, I'm sorry.  

(00:32:57)
**Speaker 0**:    Say thank you for, for, for, for all the learnings that come from the, from the conflict. And I love you love is recognize the other person as, as an equal and recognize the person values. And here we love set circles. Like maybe if, if, if a member is feeling that he or she is being like pointed out or judged, maybe we can instead of, of, of, of making him or her like, feel more judge, we can start like swarming the conflict with, with good intentions. And, and with people that help to heal the, the, the, the, also we can as assign a graviton to gather information for involved parts, and we can have a private conversation between parts.  

(00:34:10)
**Speaker 0**:    The idea of these graduated sanctions is not to impose like sanctions and to punish people. But instead of that, the idea is that according to the, to the issue, we can have a strategic responses to promote healing and wellbeing for the community and for, and for the members. Also, we are promoting a lot of confidence, confidentiality, because I think that is a very key important part of the success of any mediation process. So yes, by framing the conflict be between small meetings and big scale conflict, we can also suggest these mechanisms that are the, the alternative dispute resolution mechanisms that, that we are going to offer as an organization. And as, as, as a, as a group, we can offer negotiation that are, well, these are the self C alternative dispute solution. And we can offer negotiation. That is just for an issue that is handled directly between parts.  

(00:35:33)
**Speaker 0**:    We can have a mediation that is that the Gravitant facilitator for the conflict management suggests that it's like our boundary. I, I feel that the self composite alternative dispute solution that we can, that we can offer is like finishes when, when, when, when we have to look for other organization to address the issue. And this is something that I want to explain better with this, with this graph. So the, the idea of the, that we can have an internal management layer that offers self, self, C alternative dispute solution, so that the conflicts that arise within our organization can, can be settled within, within our internal layer and that they don't go into the exterior management, because if a conflict is really big, then it's strategically good to, to, to request for an, an external management player and to go to a hetero C trash or litigation.  

(00:37:27)
**Speaker 0**:    But the, our idea is to try to avoid gas and arbitration and try to avoid including external actors to solve our, our own issues and try to solve our own issues internally first and only request if it is actually fit for, for the, for the better management of the problem. So, like what, what, what I am trying to, to express in this, in this process tries to be like this internal management layer tries to provide this internal management layer. If we would, if we didn't have gravity, like maybe a conflict can go to, to, to, to the outside, without, but here, the idea is that we can have a previous process where, where if the thing is small, we can handle it. Fastly respond Fastly within the organization, and only request for arbitration and mitigation if we don't have our, our, the tools to manage that conflict internally. So the idea is that when a conflict happens, it, it goes through our internal management and we have our internal follow up, and we have our, our observation of the conflict, and we make our own insights and we make our own agreement. And if they work or, or if they don't work, we go to we to review our graduated sanctions and our framework for analyzing and for identifying the conflict so that they can better respond to the conflicts that may arise in the organization.  

(00:39:33)
**Speaker 0**:    Do you have any question until this moment?  

(00:39:46)
**Speaker 3**:    No, I would just say rather than strictly non-hierarchical, it, it might be said that it would be a better way to say it, to be that it's hierarchical, you know, in the sense that, you know, developmental levels of everyone and all of the levels engagement that exists within all of that. So, so to say that there's no hierarchy at all is not exactly true, but it's more of an radically inclusive version of that.  

(00:40:29)
**Speaker 0**:    Okay. Yeah, that, that makes a lot of sense. And also the protocol, I think that can be updated and reviewed. So, so yes, I think it, it's also a valid and, and very good point that you're making during us, if anyone has I prepared a meditation for today, I think it's very good and a good practice that we have, like been making in this graviton training that we have a moment to like, and having a lot of, of, of concerns, a, a lot of work, but it's also good to return for, to go to the balcony and to keep our account mind so that we can pay better or other situations that may arise. So I've never done it, but I will try that. It's a good experience for all of us. So if you want, you can close your, your camera and we will go to through the meditation.  

(00:42:21)
**Speaker 0**:    So, well, take a comfortable position wherever you are at. You can be in your seat, or if you want to be stand, you can do it as well. Try if you want, you can close your eyes or you can do it with your eyes open and try to have some deep breaths. And now try, try to gain conscious of where you are at now, where you are at, where you are at, in your house, where you're at in your city, where you're at in your country and where you're at in the world and the boundaries of your, of your body.  

(00:43:39)
**Speaker 0**:    Like you can touch your hands and you can touch your knees and touch your, your legs and get in touch with, with yourself. Try to, to see yourself and ask yourself, who are you? And what are the feelings that you have had this week? What has, what has been the most predominant thoughts that you have had in this week, or in this day, and try to recognize if those feelings and those thoughts have made you happy. And if you feel proud of feeling those feelings, and if you don't feel proud for, for feeling your feelings, also ask yourself why and what can you do to, to be more comfortable with your own thoughts and with your own feelings.  

(00:45:02)
**Speaker 0**:    So try to get a little bit inside of you and connect and understand what, what has been like the ideas that have been guiding your thoughts and your minds and your feelings now that you are deeply connected with yourself, and that you are deeply connected with your feelings without moving. And like, if you had a camera in your imagination, take three steps back from yourselves, from yourself. And now you are not seeing the world from your point of view, rather than that, you are seeing yourself as a third person. And now that you, when you see yourself and what do you feel when you times we see others as, as, as yes, as, as, as third persons as separated from ourselves. And when we see others, sometimes we think of an advice or a word that we want to say to others, but now think on an advice that you would like to tell yourself, a word that you would like to tell yourself as if you were seeing yourself as other person, because it's always very easy to advise others and to, yeah. Like we always have a good word for others, but sometimes we don't have good words for ourself. So give yourself a good advice and like, yeah, it, it, it is, it is like, like, what would you say to yourself and how do you see the feelings that you feel that, and, and that move you as  

(00:47:57)
**Speaker 0**:    To yourself outside from you? Would you tell yourself, like, would you give yourself a problem on the back and say, good job, man, you're doing amazing? Or, or, or would you say to yourself, okay, you can do better. So give yourself an advice, but try that, that advice comes with love. Don't try to judge yourself or say anything bad to, to yourself, just give yourself an advice, like, keep doing what you're doing. Put more love on what you're doing, or yes. Or, or like control your emotions, or like, be more wise with the, with the words you said, you can keep you the advice you gave to yourself. And that is a gift that you made to yourself today. And when you feel comfortable, you can tell me something to end this meditation.  

(00:50:05)
**Speaker 0**:    I want to share with you the, the experience that I had with this meditation. And it's, it's very funny because I'm moving to a new apartment. And when I got into the apartment, like some things were like falling apart and like, like things weren't as I wanted them to be. And I was feeling anxious because I was feeling like, Hey, did I did good in moving? Or what, what was it, what I wanted? And I was very anxious. And my brother told me this, told me, try to see yourself as, as if you were a third person. And what would you say to yourself? And I mean, you are,  

(00:51:09)
**Speaker 0**:    You say to a person that is having the conflict that you are living right now. And I did this and I said, I'm overreacting. And I said like, okay, maybe I would tell myself or that, or the person that I see that is having this feeling that he's just being anxious and that he should like calm down and, and start seeing things from other point of view and like, no, make, not, not making a big of deal for something small and just, and just like embrace that, that conflict will always arise. And like, there is always a pipe that is going to break and like the, it it's normal that like shit happens and anyone's life is perfect. And we, we cannot expect like to move to a, to a place and that everyone and that everything goes perfect from the first day, we have to give our energies and we have to, to, to be patient with, with ourselves as well. And this is also very, very enlightening for this experience that we are having for moving to the new server, because it it's like that, like, moving is always going to be the adapt adaptation period, but after some time, and, and after some,  

(00:53:29)
**Speaker 0**:    Well,  

(00:54:28)
**Speaker 5**:    Then I just gave myself a hug and that was awesome. I think I needed a hug. So it was nice to kind of be there for myself. So yeah, that that's all, but I really enjoyed that meditation. That was a great exercise. Thank you.  

(00:54:45)
**Speaker 0**:    Thanks, Sean. Yeah. It's, it's amazing.  

(00:54:50)
**Speaker 6**:    Yeah. I can also share something. That was a very great meditation for me. What came up was how seeing myself from outside made me talk in a more gentle way with myself, because I think I never talk to other people in the way I talk to me and then seeing this distance is like, wow, why, why do I talk to myself? So unfriendly sometimes when I always try to be friendly with others. So it was, it was really cool to have this perspective. Thanks one.  

(00:55:37)
**Speaker 0**:    Well, thanks everyone. And I hope that that having a, really what we are doing in this moment, because like, I am super hyped. I like, I am really happy about, about you all engaging in this training and what I think that we can accomplish there. The other people can, okay. Yeah, sure. Do this.  

(00:56:23)
**Speaker 3**:    I was just saying, thanks.  

(00:56:25)
**Speaker 7**:    Okay. So everyone can, it's like, don't want this to end. I was just saying, it's like, we don't want this to end Juan. This was really great. I know a lot of work went into this kind of con code of conduct through a lot of people. Lisee a lot of people in, in the T C and really how to, how to behave well with other humans.  

(00:57:02)
**Speaker 3**:    Yeah. There's way more. We keep adding and changing and improving even while we're given this training.  

(00:57:12)
**Speaker 7**:    Cool.
