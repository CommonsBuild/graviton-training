# Season 1 Session 8 - Role Play

(00:00:00)    
**Speaker 0**:    So, yes. I always say, like, we shouldn't complain about our lives because we are very privileged. And I, I also tell that to myself because like sometimes we complain about really small things, but there are people that, that are really having a really more complex situation and they are not complaining and they are just like being really honorable and, and they, they don't like try, try to affect others in that situation of, of, of, of distress. And that is something that, that I really admire because it's really easy when we are in distress to distress others, but it's the like very Sage when we are in distress and we can like keep with our hands up with our, with our heads up to what life brings us. So yes, that's like my initial reflection for today. And also I want to thank you all for coming to this eight graviton training, because as you know, this is like my first time doing this, and this is like the first time we are all doing an alternative dispute resolution cor course and training for the centralized organizations.  

(00:01:41)    
**Speaker 0**:    So yes, for me, it's like, I'm very proud of what we have been doing, and I am very proud to have you here. And I am very proud about that after this session, we will have like the first generation of gravitons and I really look forward to know the different insights that you have from this training. How can, how can it improve? What topics did we miss? And also, how can we organize more as an organization in gravity? And like, yes, I want to know all the insights that you may have to improve this, these, this initiative. And today, as we have had a lot of, of theory for today, I made, and I want to have like this group role play that is really, really fun because the world is ending and the mentor is going to crash on the earth and we have 45 minutes to find out the best possible outcome. Each of you will receive a role that has to be played in the activity. Can you find a collective solution?  

(00:03:03)    
**Speaker 0**:    I think all of you already received a role, a role, and maybe if there is a role that is missing, that is important for, for the, for the activity. Maybe I will play it, but I will give some time to, up to a person that I gave that role that he told me that he will jump in some minutes, but I would like really appreciate for, to, for you to like, take, take the, the lead of this activity and like, try to play your role and try to share what your interest is and try to share what your unique skill is and try to share like, yes, like how, what is your proposal to save and, or to, or to like solve the problem. And yes, it, it, it's, it's like a very short exercise to see how can we like reach to a solution coming from different points of view.  

(00:04:14)    
**Speaker 0**:    And I, I think that there should be like, I, I, I want to leave you like free to choose who is going to lead the activity and, and how are you going to organize and how are you going to share the different points of view and how you're you are going to collaborate. So I think that now at 3:10 PM, T we can start and I am going to let you play your roles so that you can like make the, the, the exercise. And yes, like in some, like an hour, a mentor is going to crash on, on the earth and yes, you, you have to, to find a way to, to save yourselves or, or save or save everyone. So yes, I am. I am going to stop participating in this moment.  

(00:05:29)    
**Speaker 1**:    So how, how much time do we have before the media strikes?  

(00:05:34)    
**Speaker 0**:    We have 45 minutes to get, to, to, to reach a solution. And in 50 minutes, the, the, the metric strikes at, at 4:00 PM T  

(00:05:47)    
**Speaker 1**:    Okay, guys, let's get busy. It's not much time.  

(00:05:50)    
**Speaker 2**:    I was just gonna say, I don't have a role.  

(00:05:54)    
**Speaker 0**:    I will DM to you in, in, in a, in a second.  

(00:05:59)    
**Speaker 3**:    Okay.  

(00:06:00)    
**Speaker 4**:    Can we say, what role do we have Juan or, or not, or is it secret?  

(00:06:10)    
**Speaker 0**:    No, you can share the role. What do you have the role that you have and how are you going to organize who is going to come first? Who is going to like, yeah. How, how are you going to organize to, to, to know the information from the other,  

(00:06:27)    
**Speaker 1**:    Okay, guys. So I don't have much to share or much to offer. I'm just a regular dude with no skills and no money, but I believe that if we all work together, we can get out of this mess. And I know that there's people here with a lot more skills and resources than I have. I just wanna help bring everyone together. And that's my role.  

(00:06:50)    
**Speaker 3**:    Cool. Do we, do we know anyone with military connections, anyone at Nassau or anyone that knows anything about meteor rights in this? Right.  

(00:07:00)    
**Speaker 4**:    I'm actually a scientist, but to, to stop this metric, I would like, I would need, well, we would need $20 million and I only have half a million.  

(00:07:13)    
**Speaker 3**:    Okay. I, I can, I can liquidate all my accounts and I have $2 million. So we have 2.5 million so far. Can we do it for less than two 20 million? No way I have  

(00:07:30)    
**Speaker 5**:    3 million. I have 3 million to put in, but somebody needs to let me out, locked up.  

(00:07:40)    
**Speaker 3**:    You're locked up in jail.  

(00:07:42)    
**Speaker 6**:    I am the spiritual religious advisor. And I think that we don't need to actually worry about what is actually God's will. I think what we need to do is understand that this event is out of our hands and we should no longer try and play with a fate that cannot be denied.  

(00:08:01)    
**Speaker 4**:    We should don't let this guy talk that much.  

(00:08:04)    
**Speaker 1**:    Exile, exile, Jake.  

(00:08:06)    
**Speaker 3**:    No,  

(00:08:07)    
**Speaker 7**:    It's, it's fine. We'll keep building something here while you praise for us all. I'm a politician here and I have four. I have 4 million. No, I have 1 million. No, hold on. I have $4 million, but I like to listen to the scientists because I think the only way to, you know, survive is building a bunk, a banker here that we all can get in. And I would, I would like to listen to the scientist and what, what's his solution that he, he requires 20 millions for.  

(00:08:39)    
**Speaker 3**:    Can I second that  

(00:08:41)    
**Speaker 4**:    It's actually to destroy the metric before it come to us? We will destroy it.  

(00:08:47)    
**Speaker 3**:    Yeah. I don't think we have time to build a bunker. Unfortunately. What's  

(00:08:55)    
**Speaker 8**:    I kind, I'm kind of wondering what the jail situation is like, though, that might actually already be a bunker.  

(00:09:02)    
**Speaker 6**:    We  

(00:09:02)    
**Speaker 3**:    Always, yeah. You don't wanna leave here.  

(00:09:07)    
**Speaker 2**:    I'm just gonna throw this out here. Cuz I'm a businessman and I got like 3 million in the bank. And as long as I can make some money off of this deal, then I can totally support whatever effort that you guys  

(00:09:23)    
**Speaker 8**:    Are. Are you friends with eLog? Can we just like borrow a rocket?  

(00:09:30)    
**Speaker 2**:    I, you know, I, I tried getting a hold of him earlier, but he's not answering my calls.  

(00:09:37)    
**Speaker 8**:    Yeah. I'm gonna blame.  

(00:09:39)    
**Speaker 7**:    What can I ask the businessman? What does he want the money for? If he's gonna die and all of us are gonna die. Right? I mean, if, if, if you can, if you can join your, your money with the rest of the team, you might be able to have a chance to make money after that, if we all survive. But if we all die, well,  

(00:09:54)    
**Speaker 8**:    How much do we have? If we put all our money together, I have half a million and we have been to,  

(00:10:00)    
**Speaker 2**:    Okay. I'm not sure what I, I just know my unique skill is that I don't contribute. If my interests are not met.  

(00:10:09)    
**Speaker 1**:    Hey guys,  

(00:10:09)    
**Speaker 3**:    How much is your life worth?  

(00:10:11)    
**Speaker 1**:    Let's okay. Let's not turn on each other. Most importantly. Let's just go through everyone right now. I, I, this is my vote. Let's just go through everyone and tally our cash and see how much we have.  

(00:10:21)    
**Speaker 8**:    Yeah, yeah.  

(00:10:23)    
**Speaker 3**:    To I've been tallying. We have 13. Anyone who hasn't spoken wanna add there? What do you have? Jake  

(00:10:32)    
**Speaker 6**:    Of God.  

(00:10:33)    
**Speaker 8**:    Yeah. But how much money do you have?  

(00:10:40)    
**Speaker 3**:    So what does the spiritual leader have?  

(00:10:45)    
**Speaker 6**:    2 million of God  

(00:10:47)    
**Speaker 3**:    For more 15? Has anyone else not spoken? I haven't  

(00:10:57)    
**Speaker 9**:    Million.  

(00:11:02)    
**Speaker 6**:    I am getting a message. I'm getting a message. Someone is muted. Someone in this group is muted and they need to speak. And I believe it is Santa Claus and he needs to be at  

(00:11:20)    
**Speaker 3**:    We're at 15. And I missed the last person who spoke.  

(00:11:24)    
**Speaker 6**:    I have a meeting. He can't, he can't chime in. He I'm really getting messages.  

(00:11:30)    
**Speaker 3**:    Oh, but Raphael, I'm sorry. I saw that you said something, but I didn't hear it again.  

(00:11:36)    
**Speaker 9**:    Okay. I have a meeting and I could also help bringing my violin together so we could have some music. Why we discuss how the work gonna end is everyone okay. With music  

(00:11:56)    
**Speaker 7**:    As far, as far as you bring money in? No problem with the music.  

(00:12:00)    
**Speaker 6**:    I, I just want everyone to know that I have to be gone for about seven minutes to pray and I will return.  

(00:12:06)    
**Speaker 3**:    Thank you. Pray. We get the answer. Pray. We get our, our $4 million. We don't have. How do we can, can we get the person who isn't able to speak to show some numbers on his video so we know how many millions he has. Oh, ah, Jess, you have two ah, Jessa. You mute. Okay. So five and two. So, wow. Okay. So we have 20 million. Actually. We have 20 million scientists, scientists lead us. It's  

(00:12:42)    
**Speaker 4**:    Everyone willing to give the money? The 20 million, like everyone, we  

(00:12:46)    
**Speaker 3**:    Have the business, man.  

(00:12:48)    
**Speaker 5**:    I'm not giving my money if I'm not out of this place.  

(00:12:52)    
**Speaker 4**:    And I believe, yeah, exactly.  

(00:12:55)    
**Speaker 7**:    Okay. Listen, listen, I have 1, 1, 1 other person that he couldn't join because he's not able to talk. He's mute, but he's willing to put in 5 million.  

(00:13:08)    
**Speaker 3**:    Is that Griff? Because I've already calculated that in.  

(00:13:13)    
**Speaker 7**:    Yeah. It's him.  

(00:13:14)    
**Speaker 3**:    Okay. Yeah. He, he UN videoed so he could show numbers with his hands. Okay.  

(00:13:21)    
**Speaker 7**:    Okay. So I have four. Did you, did you noted that?  

(00:13:26)    
**Speaker 3**:    Yes. I believe we're up to 23 million now, which we  

(00:13:29)    
**Speaker 7**:    Is awesome. We can, okay. We can leave away the business man, get business. He can do business with his own.  

(00:13:35)    
**Speaker 3**:    We need to get someone out of jail and we need to convince a businessman to send his, to allocate his funds jail person. How much money did you have?  

(00:13:45)    
**Speaker 5**:    I have three. And I can say who put me in jail?  

(00:13:49)    
**Speaker 3**:    Who put you in jail? Who did it?  

(00:13:52)    
**Speaker 5**:    The politician. That is trying to be so polite with everyone right now.  

(00:13:59)    
**Speaker 3**:    A politician.  

(00:14:02)    
**Speaker 7**:    Okay. I'll come with this spiritual guy and we'll get you out of there.  

(00:14:06)    
**Speaker 8**:    Yeah, we don't, we don't have time to eat each other alive. I just got back. I was having device issues, other one. So we have enough. Do we have enough money without the business, man? Is that what you're saying? TA  

(00:14:18)    
**Speaker 3**:    We have 23 million without the person in the person in jail will not give us the money. Unless they're out of jail. That's 3 million. So we could do it. If we convince the businessman, businessman, can you remind me how much money you have?  

(00:14:31)    
**Speaker 2**:    I got 3 million, but I need to make a million off of this deal.  

(00:14:37)    
**Speaker 3**:    I, I feel like we can do that. I feel like it's gonna be easier to make you a million. We will launch a bonding.  

(00:14:45)    
**Speaker 2**:    Cause at least it's like if they, if the, the,  

(00:14:48)    
**Speaker 3**:    When to get the person outta  

(00:14:50)    
**Speaker 2**:    Jail, I survive. Even if this asteroid and if I can't have a million bucks out of it, then I just don't wanna live anyways.  

(00:15:00)    
**Speaker 5**:    Well look how capitalism place, right? It's easier. It's easier to get three and pay one than take a person out of jail. Who has the three?  

(00:15:11)    
**Speaker 3**:    Yeah.  

(00:15:12)    
**Speaker 5**:    You a politician.  

(00:15:13)    
**Speaker 7**:    Why? Why? Why? Yeah, let's see. Let's say this businessman. Why? Why? If we, if we borrow that 3 million for half a million, if you die, we're not gonna bring back anything because you'll be away. But if you survive and we all survive, you'll get 3.5 million.  

(00:15:37)    
**Speaker 2**:    Okay. We don't have a lot of time. Why  

(00:15:38)    
**Speaker 1**:    Don't we get li jail? What, what, why don't we just get li jail?  

(00:15:42)    
**Speaker 3**:    What's your crime? What was the crime  

(00:15:48)    
**Speaker 1**:    Santi? It  

(00:15:49)    
**Speaker 5**:    Was a,  

(00:15:49)    
**Speaker 7**:    I just don't know. She's gotta tell us. I don't know.  

(00:15:53)    
**Speaker 5**:    Oh, you don't know. Now. You don't know. Okay. It was, it was a, it was a political crime that I was screaming out of. Freedom for free for, for everyone's freedom. And then I put in jail. I was talking about this scandals that this politician,  

(00:16:11)    
**Speaker 7**:    Okay, let's make a deal here. Let's make a deal here. I'll get you out of jail. If you give, have a million to the businessman, you put the rest on the pot and you take the spiritual guy away of this discussion.  

(00:16:31)    
**Speaker 5**:    Who am I to take the political, the spiritual guy away of discussion.  

(00:16:39)    
**Speaker 4**:    The, the clock is, is going. We  

(00:16:43)    
**Speaker 3**:    Need to, if we get her, if we, if we take her out of jail, we don't need the business guy. We just solved it. And now we just need to know what we do. How do we apply this 20 million? So do we just say, look for the good of the humans that will be not killed from this asteroid. Let's just immediately release her from jail and move forward with the scientist.  

(00:17:04)    
**Speaker 7**:    Yeah. Yeah. That's the way and forget about the business, man. I don't wanna listen to the businessman anymore. He's not with us. We'll guy on his own. We'll  

(00:17:14)    
**Speaker 3**:    We'll put him in somehow  

(00:17:17)    
**Speaker 2**:    Happen. Got  

(00:17:20)    
**Speaker 7**:    Military. He's gonna, he's not known  

(00:17:23)    
**Speaker 5**:    Anita. Yeah. He's the only one getting out of this with money.  

(00:17:29)    
**Speaker 2**:    I'm selling tickets to the, to the viewing of the asteroid.  

(00:17:39)    
**Speaker 5**:    Cancel his subscription to the resurrection.  

(00:17:45)    
**Speaker 2**:    I think that  

(00:17:46)    
**Speaker 5**:    Interesting. I don't remember the next line. Something, something  

(00:17:48)    
**Speaker 8**:    Halls of it's a, it's an adore song. The end. I think  

(00:17:54)    
**Speaker 3**:    Scientists, what do we do next? Here? We have 20 million.  

(00:17:58)    
**Speaker 4**:    Okay. Now we can give it to me and I'll destroy the  

(00:18:05)    
**Speaker 1**:    Scientist. Are we sure we can trust the scientist? Just gimme the money. It'll be fine.  

(00:18:16)    
**Speaker 8**:    It's like a south park episode where money, I got the money. Didn't know more asteroids.  

(00:18:24)    
**Speaker 1**:    Put his money in an as  

(00:18:31)    
**Speaker 8**:    I'm I'm kind of thinking maybe the scientist sent the asteroid as it means to get the 20 million million. The a,  

(00:18:47)    
**Speaker 0**:    Well, I, I think it was like really fast and that you re do it, did it really good because like, maybe it could have been more complex, but I did it like so that everyone could like, so that the activity could be solved like fast. And I am actually really surprised because like, it took you 15 minutes to like listen to everyone and like get to an agreement between you. So I mean, that, that is best. That, that, that I thought that you would do. I, I thought that it would be like more complex for you to, to reach to disagreement. But honestly, I thought that it would be, it would have been easier to give the money to the, to the businessmen than, than taking like Livia out of jail, but it was co opposite. And you like prefer to, to take Livia out of jail than giving the businessman some money.  

(00:19:52)    
**Speaker 0**:    So it it's like, it was really funny. And the other thing that I wanted to, to show in this, in this activity is that sometimes we have leaders, normal leaders in our community, like grief. But today I chose to muted him because we have to be able to, to take decisions and to listen to each other and to organize even in the, in, in the moments that our leaders cannot like guide us, like, or be present as, as they normally are. So, so yeah, it's good that, that we can listen to each other and that we can see that each of us has different unique skills and different interests, but we can all like gather to take the, the, and to fight common enemies. So I think, I, I think it it's, it, it was really good. Maybe I should have made it more complex, but that's something that, that needs to be like polished.  

(00:20:59)    
**Speaker 0**:    But this, this was like my initial proposal, because this was an activity that I made in, in my life. And like, it really made me think about how, how, how can, how do we react in these kind of situations? So, yes, I think it, it was really funny and I wanted to close this graviton training with something funny and with some, and also with, with something where you, where you could put into practice, what we have taught, talked in all the sessions that is like, we need to, to, to listen to people. And if we, if people have different interest, we, we can like try to, to, to, to get them into zones of possible agreement. And also if there is people that, that, that doesn't like want to contribute, that there are ways to talk with them. And if, if there are people that like to like promote their point of view, they, there are all always different responses to, to, to, to one same situation. So, yeah, it, it, it was really funny for me from this side and like, you, you did it great. That's the only thing that I have to say, because maybe it, it would have been more complex. It would have taken more time, but I liked how, how, how it went and with all the difficulties that is just like a really basic exercise. And we are doing it in, in, in, in this media.  

(00:22:45)    
**Speaker 0**:    So the  

(00:22:47)    
**Speaker 1**:    Prayer worked, Jake saved us. Lifestyles did not save you our great and only one powerful God did, but thank you. Thank you for understanding and seeing the power in all of us.  

(00:23:07)    
**Speaker 0**:    Okay. And now I want to know if you have any feedback for the graviton trainings, how have you felt in, in these trainings? Like what, what suggestion can you make? And yes, this is like a closing exercise for this gravitons training. So I would like to hear you, what do you want to say?  

(00:23:36)    
**Speaker 4**:    Thank you so much. B it was super fun. Like the whole training and this last episode, like, I feel like we have to do more of this in TC. This is so fun and this is so cool. And we learn a lot having fun. That's that's huge. Thank you so much.  

(00:23:54)    
**Speaker 3**:    Yeah. I wanna, I wanna say too, like overall, these sessions have been fantastic. You can say, hi, she's having trouble sleeping. And I think that there's, there's been, I feel like I don't wanna say so what Zep is said, the, it felt like an escape game, which is always like, kind of thrilling and exciting. And I'd love that we do more of these in TEC as well. Just, I, I don't know. It would be great, but I feel like these entire sessions have been really sharpening skills and practicing, and I really enjoyed that. You led us through all of that. So, so well, and so, so nicely, I really appreciate this whole training session.  

(00:24:44)    
**Speaker 0**:    Okay. I also want to say that the total, the total of pops are six. So there are two sessions that will receive the same pop that are the seven and the sixth and the fourth and the eighth one, because the fourth and the eight ones where the, the ones with exercises. So if any of you of you don't have the fourth one, I can send it to you. But the total of, of pops is six. And with four of them is the requirement to enter into the grav into, into the gravity working group. So, or to become a gravity. So like, yes, I, I really would love to keep seeing all of you and to see what kinda of things we can make of from this initiative of bringing alternative dispute resolution into the data system.  

(00:25:45)    
**Speaker 5**:    Yeah. I really appreciate the, the training one. Thank you so much. I think it's so special to have space between so much work and so much very like mental logical things that we're doing all the time to, to have yeah. Space to reflect, to meditate, to think about how we're treating each other. How can we be better? How can we help others? And I, I think you did an amazing job on providing the space. And I'm really curious to see how the development of gravity is gonna be and curious about the next steps too, of how the gravity tons will get together, how the process will develop and how we'll have this like really alive in our community.  

(00:26:46)    
**Speaker 0**:    Well, thank you all. Thank you. And with that, if you want to say something more, I think that we can close this session really early. And I think it was a really fun and, and exciting exercise, and we did it really fast, but the idea is for us to be able to be fast, to find solutions because all the time we're going to have problems and all the time, each people is going to have a different interest and, and we will need all to, to, to like, yeah, sharpen this skills for us to be able to, to, to, to see solutions when, when, when conflicts are presented to us and to be able to hear what everyone has to say and what everyone has to offer. Because if like we wouldn't have heard one of us, we couldn't have reached the solution that you reached really fast.  

(00:27:54)    
**Speaker 2**:    I just wanna say, thank you for, thank you, Juan, for bringing this graviton training and everybody else who helped to make it real. And for introducing me to the TC, this seems like just a really awesome community. And I feel blessed to have come, come this way. So thank you.  

(00:28:21)    
**Speaker 0**:    Thanks everyone. So with no more to say, I would like to thank you and to wish you really good day and that we have, this is not the end, rather, this is like the start. And I think that it would be really nice that we have a working group session maybe at this same hour next week, but I would propose a doodle to see, which is the best schedule that suits all of us. Yeah. To keep working on this initiative and to see how can we like keep ma matching this idea, when are, when it's going to be the next training? What, what are the next organizations that we are going to approach? Yeah. That there are, there is a lot of things that, that we need to, to, to settle down and we should also make a roadmap of what is our scope. And yeah. Try, try to be full with this, with this project. And I really appreciate all your support.  

(00:29:33)    
**Speaker 1**:    Hey, hold on. I just wanna say as well, thank you so much for all these sessions and thanks to everyone else involved, Livy and Durga and everyone else who was behind the scenes in gravity. And yeah. It's, I think this has been a really almo I don't know if intense is the right word, but for me, yeah. Intense. Like it, it really is like Livy said skills sharpening and in it's like a bootcamp almost, but a different, you know, I think a bootcamp, I think of like programming or, but this is like a social skills bootcamp, and it's really transformative. And also I think the co-ops are super cool. Like, I'm really proud of my co-ops to be able to have those on chain for all time. Like to be able to say, I'm one of the, I went through the first round of graviton training. I think it's just really amazing. Like Dan said, it's a blessing to be here and yeah. And, and I think just, it may be since this is the last session, it's nice to hold the space in case any, and people might have some closing remarks or anything they wanna share.  

(00:30:45)    
**Speaker 1**:    Yeah. Just so maybe I'll, I'll pass it off back to Yon, but if anyone wants to share anything, cuz I, like I said, this whole experience was kind of intense. So people might have any sort of last words they want to pass on. I'm not sure.  

(00:31:01)    
**Speaker 8**:    Well, this, this was something that I was doing like for my personal self, not necessar, not, not to pick up a role though. I will have called on of course, but it was something I was doing for myself because nonviolent communication is something that I've been working on for a couple of years, few years, and participating in the class has, I think really been a pivotal thing in, in helping me shift my frame of reference, I guess. And it's coming at exactly the right time because I'm going back to visit Alaska, to see my friends and have to my husband. One of my ex-husband one of my sons and my mother are all in the same area where I'll be going. And my son and I have been kind of tense because I got divorced and he is very religious and it, this is helping me have a reference kind of like I'm, I'm not going to go out on my way.  

(00:32:18)    
**Speaker 8**:    I'll tell my son I'm coming. Of course. But you know, like in case I run into somebody, you know, there's gonna be like, especially if I run into my ex-husband, there's gonna be a high fear level and deciding, you know, giving me the tools to work through it. Actually I should probably talk if somebody would like to talk to me and help me through like maybe do some role playing sometime in the next week or two, that would be super helpful. And I'll just stop there because that, you know, I just need to do something. So I don't like fall apart. If I run into somebody,  

(00:32:51)    
**Speaker 0**:    Well, we are Gravitant as, and as we try to support to support the community, we also try to support each other. So like, yes, if anyone has any problem and, and want to, to receive some help from us, we, we, we are here and we are going to be here for the, for the community. That's something that we have to be available. We have to available for people to reach out to us and we have to be available for people because sometimes in this heart, in these times that we are, that we are living at our heart. So sometimes we just need someone to, to hear what we have to say and to give us some feedback or to like help us see things from a different point of view. So that, that, that is something that I want to like remark that this is a very human act.  

(00:33:48)    
**Speaker 0**:    And that's why I think that gravity is not something like we support tech, but it's not something that we need tech to, to, to make gravity like, like technology. I I'm referring technology. We don't need that much technology to make gravity. We, we just need to, to, to be there for the other one as human and, and that's it. So it's like, it's, it's like yes, to, to support each other more, more, more than, than to rely on, on, on, on, on a third one to take a decision or to rely on, on, on a system we are relying on, on, on that. When anyone needs support there, there are others there to be there for them. And yeah.  

(00:34:47)    
**Speaker 8**:    Yeah. Thank you. I, I would, you know, if anybody wants to just reach out to me or I don't know how, what the process would be, it's not something I would wanna ask somebody because it's actually a lot, I mean, I'd like help, but I wouldn't actually like try to pin it on it.  

(00:35:09)    
**Speaker 0**:    Count with me. Count, count with me a hundred percent and well, if anyone has anything else to say, we can wrap up this session early.  

(00:35:22)    
**Speaker 8**:    Thank  

(00:35:30)    
**Speaker 3**:    You. Can't hear you somethings.  

(00:35:36)    
**Speaker 0**:    Okay. Now.
