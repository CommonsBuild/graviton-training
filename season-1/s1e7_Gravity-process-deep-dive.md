## Transcript

(00:00:00)    
**Juan Carlos**:    I want to present the document that we have been writing and producing in gravity, because the idea after the end of this training is that we can have  a planning session to design a new roadmap and to plan our roadmap as a group, after the training is done. 

I want to show you,, what was the initial document where gravity like. What was first like sketch? It was this document. I invite all of you to open these documents and to take some time to read them because it's like a work that we have been doing for months. 

### Gravity Deep dive

### [Conflict Management for the TEC](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J2Vrlb7zXcnCIWf-xmylCY39bL88PJLibz5AdXy-e2M/edit#heading=h.a6hblvgzwj5q)

This is like where we first made the proposal name and why did we do it? How are we going to do gravity? And all of this is like the basis that let us to be doing this training right now. It says what we're doing, how we're going to do it. We are trying to follow Elenor Ostrom's principles, especially four, five, and six. 

Here it is like all day, the information that is stands, how gravity, what was being built. Like we want to have transference human monitoring. It's amazing that right now we have another working group that is called transparency.  

That is like really close to the activities that gravity is doing and that they compliment each other because they are helping us on the part of the human monitoring and on the mutual monitoring. 

Then we are also also trying to help on the part of accountability and graduate extensions, and on the part of easy access for conflict management. Like gravity is born in the TEC and is nurtured from the other working groups. 

As we have already had Livi from the soft gov working group, presenting a session, both transparency, soft gov legal and gravity are groups that work really close together. With all the working groups. 

Here you can, you can read what was the idea and how we were going to like, measure the scale of the sanctions and the scale of the problems and how we were going to promote a strategic nonviolent communication and the alternative dispute resolution mechanisms.  

(00:04:08)    
You can see where we gathered all the ideas to do what we are doing now. We have here like draft for conflict management resolution program from the TEC, which can eventually support other the community. It says we could, we could have conflict management training once a year, each one ending with a conflict management certification. That is what we are doing. 

We are following these steps and people who pass the trainees. So this soft skills can be, can be part of this trusted group. This plan that we have been following and is leading us to this moment with where we are right now, these are the values of and the principles of the organization that we saw last week. 

That is for social human centered safety, integrity, open source, transparent account, accountable value driven.  

These are some of the reference that we had to propose the process of gravity, one of the parties approaches to an alternative dispute solution center that in this case would be gravity and request a mediation. 

Gravity provides a list of names of available mediators from which the parties may elect the mediator, the mediator, the list will be done after this training, the list of gravity that will be available. the parties will provide gravity with the relevant documents pertaining to the dispute. 

The gravity provides that information to the mediator. Yes, these are like the steps that we have been trying to follow. You, you can see that this is not like the same, but we have been taking some orientation from other institutions.  

### [Gravity Working Group Manifesto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yrEcPoOW8Q1qDE-YWWF0MhXlcvpiMk0jmdQx25nfZ6k/edit#)

Then we have like some, so there, there's like a little bit of background on what we are doing on top of that. We have the gravity manifesto that is the manifesto of the working group. 

What is state, what is the goal that we are pursuing and what is the deadline of our, of our scope of our roadmap. This is something that I want to share with you, because this is also really important for transparency, for all the people to understand what is the manifesto, and this is updated. 

This is something that we will be working on after the training here, you can see,, what's our goal, trained members of the community and skills to promote non-violent communication, empathy, understanding, and management of conflict, to build a culture of wellbeing and trust between members of the community. 

Also manage conflict and support soft governance rules inside the TEC improve the co code of conduct defined, graduated sanctions that as we saw are not like sanctions to punish more as sanctions to restore and like actions to teach people and to correct behavior. But in a very loving way, we also have been defining the role of the conflict mediator. That is the role of gravitons.  

This is something that we will have to review as a collective. What is the success of our working group that people in the community recognize the cultural build and ed extensions, acting coherently to the values in the organization, but when there ares steps in assistance in of solutions, this map and in the 11th of March. We ends next week after, after the eighth session.

I am proposing that after in two weeks, when we have our first generation of graviton, we still gather at the same time to have like a hack session on what contributions the gravitons can contribute to this new roadmap, because there are some things that we still like need to think about. We need to schedule the next training that hopefully happens the same year.  

(00:09:16)    
**Juan Carlos**:    We also need to define a marketing and a relationship strategy to search for other organizations and to promote our service between DAOs so that we can provide the service. We have to do financial planning, how are we going to sustain the work and how are we going to reward the gravitons? 

This is like a very open discussion that I wouldn't like want to impose my own point of view, but rather I think that between the group of gravitas we can, we can reach to really good agreement.  

### [Gravity Wg- Transparency audit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EeLkV7SmyYW6Aof1qHtVu5EV4PgRTOZ7W12f0vv36ws/edit#heading=h.nl13ggl812up)

I would appreciate if you can put your name here in this list of members in the manifesto, so that we can see all the people that has been contributing to this, to this working group. Also, as I have been talking about transparency, there is this really amazing document that accepts and IBD. 

I think that is a really amazing initiative that complements very well with gravity and is to have like outed of the working groups, because if we want to have,, transparency's not only to say that we are transparent, but to have certain accountability methods that are public, where people can see what we are doing and which stages are we, are we, are we on which stages of our, of our roadmap are we? 

And the idea of this outage is that they are public to the organization, so that if anyone sees that the outed doesn't reflect the work that is being done in the, in the working group, they can like talk about it so that we can see what is happening and what was the lack of transparency in the working group or what, or not just like to investigate, but more to prevent, and to show that everything that we are doing is like open to review and that everyone can have access to all the information that is being made and produced in the TEC.  

(00:12:11)    
**Juan Carlos**:    And also that we ourselves can show the work that we, that we are doing, because transparency is really good also to promote the good things that we are doing. Transparency is not like to show the bad things that happen. It is to promote and to invite people to be very communicative for the work that they're doing for the whole community. 

This is the criteria and that they are using. Does the manifesto reflect the current goals of the working style of the team. This was my answer. Our current roadmap proposes the start of a conflict management platform, but we have to update the roadmap regarding the next steps after the hatch, to offer conflict management service organization. 

It's really important that we, as Gravitons also support this kind of jobs, because this is, these are jobs to promote trust in the, in the community and trust in the work that has been done and that, and that we have no problem of showing what we're doing.  

I am saying that it would be very important to have a hack session after the graviton trainings to prepare the new strategy for post, and also to include contribution from graviton. Until now the main task of the contributors is to participate in the gravity trainings and claim the pops. 

After the graviton training is done, you will have other responsibilities within the working group. 

We encourage you to take responsibilities because this is something that we are promoting and that for the success of it needs like participation from multiple points of view and different people, and not just like unidirectional way of doing things. 

I want to show what we are doing and what we are trying to be held accountable for. and that we are also monitoring ourselves. 

This is a very important issue also to put in practice Ostrom's principles. We are monitoring ourselves. It's not an external entity who is monitoring our behavior or our actions, what the ones that monitor our activities, ourselves. 

###	[Gravity Wg call notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19tpH6EU8jYX4FQ0CBtUf0MdsLzjpVo5x7n9W38u9Us4/edit)

Here are also the notes of the working group calls that we had before starting this training. Here are the notes for, for the introductory session that we had, where people like shared a little bit about their themselves, and like what brought them there. 

You can see that this, what we are doing is the, is the product of work that has been done through several months. 

I really like thank all the people that have been working in these documents like Griff, Livi do. Yes, because it's also the reflect of the advice process that we have in this community. 

When you have an idea other people like foster you to improve that idea and give those and give you like idea other ideas to handle, to how to ground your ideas, or give you very good questions that make you reflect on your initial thinking and how you can improve that.  

This is something really good for the community to provide this advice, service and this advice process.  

### [Forms for mediation - conciliation agreements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RgL9QANBhq6KqtETCYEEEsFSJvHUw0K5VD58qWPUBTk/edit?usp=sharing)

Now I want to show what is going to be the form that we are going to fill for the mediation or conciliation sessions. This is the mediation form. It's a very standard form. The idea is that here we put the organization name like Aragon, for example, or Token Engineering Commons. 

Here we can know what is the organization. This is the mediation session that we are going to lead, which are the participants, and that are involved. These are some of the ground rules of the session. 

It's like the party selling. They were to settle a dispute set up in one scheduled mediation. If the mediator agreed upon the parties cannot or does not accept an invitation to media, then the parties may agree on choosing another mediation from the graviton.  

(00:17:56)    
The mediators shall endeavor to assist the parties, to settle the dispute by agreement, and unless agreed otherwise the mediators shall not educate the dispute, recommend that a solution to the dispute advise a party on the marriage of the dispute or negotiate a supplement of the dispute in the health of a party. 

The mediator shall have the discretion to conduct the mediation of the dispute in such manner as the mediator that they mean on unless otherwise agreed by reading, in reading, by the parties, the mediator shall be administered by the mediation shall be administered by the parties. 

The mediator may communicate with the parties orderly or in writing together or individually, and may convene a meeting after consulting the parties, each party undertake to cooperate in good faith with the mediator in the conduct of the mediation of the dispute.  

The mediation proceedings shall be confidential and conducted without reduced base basis. The mediators shall not disclosure to any person other than a party, any information first obtained during the mediation of the dispute without the prior written consent of the parties on, or unless compelled by law to do so. 

This is like a form that Gravitons, we will have, and for every mediation session or conation that we may have, we are going to take notes. 

We are going to follow this ground rules, and we are gonna take notes from the session according to these steps, first, we are going to talk about feelings. 

These steps are very close to the steps of non nonviolent communication. I am assuming that previous step in the mediation we start with an initial observation, and then we share feelings and we take notes from the feelings of the parts.  

(00:20:06)    
It's important for every part to feel heard and to value the feelings of each party, and to take the feelings as something valuable to uncovering the solution of the dispute. 

Then we move into identifying needs on what caused the initial situation and what are the needs that reflect that need to be addressed through, through the dispute. 

The feelings then reflect what are the needs that are in like in the center of the conflict so that we can like also then move to identify and to propose requests where each of the parties can give a little part and receive a little part so that we build the bridge between the zone of possible agreement.  

After we identified that the needs of each of the parties were where can be met. and that we identify what are the prior things for each one of them, then we try to formulate requests: What can you give? What can I give? so that we can meet halfway. 

Then we would try to talk about what can we learn from this? Because after every dispute, there's something that we can learn and some good ouTEComes that, or insight points that we can take from that dispute. Then we can have like a reconciliation. 

That is something that I promote, but that depends on how the GRA graviton feels about their process. They have certain autonomy on if they want to make a ritual of reconciliation, or if they want to do a meditation, or if they want to go without. But it's really good to wrap the issue with that. To say, okay, now that we have talked all this, let's wrap this and let's like, move on with our life.  

The reconciliation that I propose is on open that you like already have heard me talk about it. It's for people to say to the other: I'm sorry. Please Forgive me. Thank you. I love you. Just like pronouncing this between, between two parties, the, those, that like breaks the ice and heals the wounds. 

It's like a good way to end the session. These are the only two topics that are like done by the, by the mediator, after the meeting. 

Was there an agreement they have to say yes or no? And they describe the agreement if necessary. 

Describe what happened, not what happened, the solution and what, each of the parties like gave and what each of the parties like received. We can state how that bridge was built between the two parties and what was the agreement that was, that was taken in the situation. 

This is a form that you, you will all have, and for when the moment is right, that you have to ate any session. Then we will have a spreadsheet where we will have only the information relating to if there is to the, if there was an agreement and what was the graviton that took the the case, and some links to follow the thread and the date of the agreement. 

###	[Gravity group registry spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HH1lhY4HScQzE1f7cjk89lkoMu3Uw3vmPbFsu97jZa4/edit?usp=sharing)

It's a registry that we will have for the sessions that, and mediation services that we provide.  

### Certification for what?
![](https://i.imgur.com/jNKrvaU.png)\
[https://imimediation.org/practitioners/certify/](https://imimediation.org/practitioners/certify/)


Why it is so important to receive the pop-ups and why is so important to certify ourselves as gravitons. I am not making this with from what I think only, but there are reference that we have been using to promote this, this group. 

One of this reference is the international mediation Institute, and what do they do? They first train the people and then make the people have experience on the training that they had. Then after they certify the people, the people is competent and able to provide the service of mediation. 

This is an international mediation Institute that is fully functional. We are also like taking this career pathway, so that after the training, we will gain experience. 

Then we will be able to provide this service to the centralized organizations. So, yes, that is the point of the certification that we have taken time, that we have studied, that we have accepted certain requirements of the role and that we are competent to provide the service that we say that we will provide, the mediation in disputes.  

### ADR for DAOs

> 1. We have training courses twice or three times a year. that rewards NFTs.
> 2. People who pass the training and show they have the soft skills and understanding of conflict management can become part of this trusted group of conflict resolution supporters inside their organizations. 
> 3. We are organizing in a decentralized way (DAO), promoting meritocracy and good will. The TEC is funding our project to advance the token engineering field. We use Dework to manage the treasury. 
> 4. Agreements are tracked to ensure accountability. Web3 integration for agreements planned.
> 5. The conflict management process doesn’t end on potential agreements. We work on trust creation and continued education around conflict competence
> 6. Mediation works as a way to reach fast and amicable agreements looking for common interest
> 7. Avoids affectation of organizations from conflict by controlling de drama around it.

(00:28:10)    
This is like the steps that we have been following to provide alternative dispute solution for DAOs. As I said, we will have this training courses twice or three times a year. The people who pass the training can become part of this trusted group of conflict solution supporters. 

This is something that I would like to talk with the gravitons when we finish this training and how are we going to promote meritocracy and good will, and how are we going to have our parameters of our DAO, or even for the organization. 

The agreements are tracked to ensure accountability. That is the registry spreadsheet, but also that document is private. I just show with you because there is nothing in that document, but after this graviton training, this document is going to be private. 

The conflict management process doesn't end on on the potential agreement, then we can have KPIs or follow up or strategies to keep up with some of the conflicts or some of the situations that may arise. 

We can like see the progress that they have been having after the action of gravity and like to see even, and to have our own measurements of how, of the impact that we have, if, if how many conflicts can we like mediate? 

Or how many of, or what are the situations that are harder, or, yes, these are some like questions that will arise eventually. That we will be that we will need to be prepared to ask ourselves and to look for answers.  

(00:30:46)    
This is something really important, this is a very voluntary process that can be called by one of four, both parts, but to proceed, there should be willingness to address the issue by all parts involved. 

When one part doesn't recognize, or doesn't want to address the issue through gravity, we cannot force them to do it like this. This whole thing is based on dialogue and in communication and when, and in recognition of a possible agreement. 

When the parts don't want to do that, then that is the boundary where we, where we like where we finish our, or where we can like push forward. We will need to find what are going to be like the scaling methodologies that we are going to use. 

### Conflict management cycle in the TEC
![](https://i.imgur.com/vXdvm2U.png)

If a problem cannot be solved through gravity, what is going to be that second layer that I show here, we are going to have an internal management layer, but how are we going to provide, or what are going to be the institutions that we will rely on when, when the capabilities of handling the issue on an internal way fall short in a complex situation.  

We still have a lot of work to do, the end of graviton training is not the end to your activity in gravity. Instead, that's to start your activity in gravity.
