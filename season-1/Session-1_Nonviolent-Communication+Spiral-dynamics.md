## Nonviolent Communication

**a) [Brief summary of Non Violent Communication by Marshall Rosenberg](https://srinathramakrishnan.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/non-violent-communication-summary.pdf)**

This is a chapter outline of key points related in Marshall Rosenberg's [Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life](https://puddledancer.bookstore.ipgbook.com/nonviolent-communication--a-language-of-life--3rd-edition-products-9781892005281.php). (PuddleDancer Press)

> If "violent" means acting in ways that result in hurt or harm, then much of how we communicate—judging others, bullying, having racial bias, blaming, finger pointing, discriminating, speaking without listening, criticizing others or ourselves, name-calling, reacting when angry, using political rhetoric, being defensive or judging who's "good/bad" or what's "right/wrong" with people—could indeed be called "violent communication." 

> Nonviolent Communication is the integration of four things: 
> * Consciousness: a set of principles that support living a life of compassion, collaboration, courage, and authenticity  
> * Language: understanding how words contribute to connection or distance  
> * Communication: knowing how to ask for what we want, how to hear others even in disagreement, and how to move toward solutions that work for all  
> * Means of influence: sharing "power with others" rather than using "power over others"  

> Nonviolent Communication serves our desire to do three things: 
> * Increase our ability to live with choice, meaning, and connection
> * Connect empathically with self and others to have more satisfying relationships
> * Sharing of resources so everyone is able to benefit

  > All human beings have an innate capacity for compassion, but it is easy to become detached from this capacity in our pursuit to get our way. But when we get our way through fear, guilt, shame, or coercion, we are just as likely to suffer as those who give in to our will.
  > 
  > Violent communication need not be malevolent; often, it is automatic and habitual. In this article, we will explore Nonviolent Communication (NVC), a process through which we can learn to express ourselves clearly and honestly while listening to our needs and others.

## Spiral Dynamics

**c) [Using Spiral Dynamics to understand development](https://medium.com/@jthowlett/using-spiral-dynamics-to-understand-development-930098e8f092)**

> [Ken Wilber](https://integrallife.com/), the American writer on transpersonal psychology and his own [integral theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_theory_(Ken_Wilber)), has used and popularised Spiral Dynamics in his work.
> Spiral Dynamics was developed by [Don E. Beck and Cristopher Cowan](https://www.talent.wisc.edu/Home/Portals/0/LMD/Beck%20Cowan-Managing%20Spiral%20Dynamics%20-%20Introduction.pdf), based on the pioneering work of developmental psychologist [Clare W. Graves](https://www.clarewgraves.com/home.html).
> 
> Spiral Dynamics is a model and language which describes the development of people, organisations and society. It helps us understand the value systems (what they care about and what motivates them) of different people and organisations, as they move through distinct stages of development.

**d) [Integral Dynamics, A new integration of Wilber’s Integral Theory and Spiral Dynamics](http://www.ijhssnet.com/journals/Vol_6_No_6_June_2016/10.pdf)**

> Currently we get caught up in deep crises that follow each other faster and faster. In this paper, we develop a coherent analytical framework that may tackle the major problems of our time in a coherent and integrated way. We present a new integration of Wilber’s Integral Theory and Spiral Dynamics that provide more possibilities for analysis: IntegralDynamics. Upon these Integral Dynamics our approach is as follows. Wilber describes four holarchies from the perspectives of the quadrants. We move on to octants and we ascertain that the value systems of Spiral Dynamics, with their typical colours, fit in this extended scheme of Wilber.

* [A Matter of Perspective](https://spirals.blog/) - Spirals Blog
  * [Behavior ≠ Intention](https://spirals.blog/articles/behaviour-vs-intention/)
    > Can you remember a time when someone you knew (a friend, a lover, a boss, etc.) was doing something you just didn’t understand? It would go on for what felt like ages until, eventually, you realized why they were doing it. It dawned on you the real reason for their behavior (something they may not have even realized themselves), and your whole perspective shifted?
  * [Wholearchy over Hierarchy](https://spirals.blog/articles/wholearchy/)
    > Our house’s foundation isn’t worth less than the walls. In the same way that the roof is not better than the door. Looking at Perspective as a “wholearchy” puts things under a different light. It places a much-deserved emphasis on founding perspectives like “Purple” and “Red” simultaneously removing the misplaced significance of more complex colors such as Yellow and Turquoise (and for many, Green and Orange). Taking away the “hierarchy” allows us to view all colors equally, to be seen objectively, and treated fairly. It balances our understanding of Perspective.
  * [The Individual & The Collective](https://spirals.blog/articles/i-vs-we/)
    > If you’ve studied Spiral Dynamics for long enough, you may have noticed that a pattern forms between the colors. Beige looks out for itself, and Purple looks out for the tribe/family/friends. Red looks for glory and significance and Blue looks to sacrifice itself for a higher power (organization, nation, religion, etc.). Orange does whatever it can to be the best and look good doing it, only for Green to forget it all and only looks out for the world. And so on…
  * [Disentanglement Theory](https://spirals.blog/articles/disentanglement/)
    > Disentanglement Theory is an attempt to get to the bottom of things, The real bottom, and then heal it. It requires courage, patience, empathy, love, strength, and intuition. It builds emotional intelligence, your sense of love for yourself and the world, deeper happiness, and a generally pretty chillin’ vibe. It’s sweet.

## Divided & Unified Ways Of Thinking

![](https://i.imgur.com/Z7QDVnx.png)

Divided and Unified ways of thinking in context of decolonization, which Regis Chapman (@Durgadas) presents upon in detail: 

[I AM THE PROBLEM: Responsibility & Freedom in a Post-Colonized World - Durgadas 2021 01 13](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2bwxv7z6ixwag28/I%20AM%20THE%20PROBLEM-Decolonization-Draft%203.pptx?dl=0) ([Youtube](https://youtu.be/lxi76vO-hJY)))

e) [My stroke of insight - Jill Bolte Taylor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyyjU8fzEYU&feature=emb_logo) (video)

This video describes the experience of having a stroke, which allowed Jill Bolte Taylor, a scientist, direct view to the inner workings of her mind. This experience granted her a "stroke" of insight, regarding the difference between right and left brain thinking, and how our brains define our realities.

> I pictured a world filled with beautiful, peaceful, compassionate, loving people who knew that they could come to this space at any time. And that they could purposely choose to step to the right of their left hemispheres – and find this peace.

**Tuning to the Unified**

![](https://i.imgur.com/nFjz4KZ.png)

> Unified thinking is based on the understanding that there is no difference between the world we see and our inner self. And that duality comes from within our mind. “The world appears to you, as your mind is.”
> 
> This graphic illustrates the underlying principles of the mind which creates the duality or Maya, called Gunas. With understanding, self-compassion and detachment we can turn the various strategies of abuse (the combination of hiding and projecting) into health.

* [Crossing over Maya - Snake and Rope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mI8Er-OfJj0)
  > When I am not able to apprehend the rope as the rope, the mind projects that it is a snake. This projected, illusory, and non-existing snake makes you unhappy, miserable, sorrowfull. When you discover the rope as a rope, on apprehending the rope, the misapprehensions dissapear. This trick of the mind, of non apprehension of the higher reality because of its the mind is misinterpreting and projecting a world of brutality, this trick of the human mind is called a Maya 
* [The Three Gunas Explained - 10 Minutes with Dr. Marc Halpern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzIRZs-vrVc)
  > These three qualities are called sattva, rajas, and tamas, in sanskrit. These three gunas are responsible for the functioning of your mind, they also do affect the body. They affect everything in nature, but in our conversation, we usually bring it into the conversation about the mind. What is your mind like? Is your mind clear, like sattva? Is it turbulent, like rajas? Is it more inert and darker, like tamas?


## Questions

1. How does NVC help to build trust and prevent conflicts?
2. What is Spiral Dynamics and how does it understand development?
3. What is the difference between separated and unified thinking?
