## Notes

**THE LEGACY OF NARCISSISM**

**ASSERTION:** COLONIZATION IS A WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL & GOVERNANCE-LEVEL EXPRESSION OF NARCISSISTIC ABUSE

One can see this as the following approaches to recovery from Narcissistic Abuse are identical in approach, different in context:

- A person escaping an abusive partner (intimate relationships)
- A person recovering from being raised by a narcissist (family relationships)
- A person recovering from being indoctrinated by education facilities, [colleges](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jan/14/rhodes-must-fall-oxford-colonialism-zimbabwe-simukai-chigudu) and other “public” instruction.
- Social justice movements- ([who are protesting the horrific, genocidal and normalized colonized cultural violence](https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/08/09/black-lives-matter-is-not-a-terrorist-organisation) of our working people, everywhere; and are [thus labeled “terrorists”](https://fee.org/articles/thomas-sowell-social-justice-philosophy-is-a-blank-check-for-government-power/)) to the [now-pervasive perjorative SJW term.](https://fee.org/articles/thomas-sowell-social-justice-philosophy-is-a-blank-check-for-government-power/) How Social Justice (the idea that “
[1) things are not right and that 2) the government should make them right. Where right all too often means cosmic justice, trying to set things right means writing a blank check for a never-ending expansion of government power.”](https://fee.org/articles/thomas-sowell-social-justice-philosophy-is-a-blank-check-for-government-power/)) itself has been co-opted to mean “expansion of government power”.
- Environmentalist movements ([who are protesting the horrific, genocidal and normalized colonized cultural violence of our planet](https://grist.org/article/the-term-eco-terrorist-is-back-and-its-killing-climate-activists/), everywhere and are thus [labeled “terrorists”](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780128014783/environmental-and-animal-rights-extremism-terrorism-and-national-security#book-description))
- [Animal rights movements](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17539150903010715?scroll=top&needAccess=true&journalCode=rter20) (who are [protesting the horrific, genocidal and normalized colonized cultural violence](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17539150903010715?scroll=top&needAccess=true&journalCode=rter20) of animals everywhere and [thus labeled “terrorists”](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17539150903010715))
- The MANY countries who have declared Independence Days from England and other European countries ***“World-wide, British Leaving Day is never out of season.” –Walter Russell Mead***
- **['Colonialism had never really ended': my life in the shadow of Cecil Rhodes](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jan/14/rhodes-must-fall-oxford-colonialism-zimbabwe-simukai-chigudu?utm_source=pocket-newtab)**

    It’s important to note that ALL co-opted institutions from such countries are conscripted to enforce this violent, exclusionary and often genocidal warfare to ensure compliance, and this is a feature of narcissistic abuse at every level of its expression from intimate relationships to the entire world.

    It is easy to see this just by looking at current events.

## Transcript

(01:11)    
**Durgadas**:    Okay, so I'm just gonna start. This is the very first real presentation I've done on all this. I've spent the last 10 or so years gathering this information and particularly in the last five years. Some of that comes from the fact that I started about that time to work at a native band. Simultaneously my wife, who is, who has a gold medal in the Commonwealth games is civil medal in the pan am games in a bronze medal in the Olympic games was basically chased out of her teaching profession due to racism. So the combination of those two things along with the election of Donald Trump, which brought up the post-traumatic stress from my own narcissistic father, who is functionally identical to him, and all of these things created this tension within me a bit.  

(02:15)    
**Durgadas**:    Like we talk about spiral dynamics where there's this real desire to understand what's going on. Simultaneously I was in a yellow period. If any of you guys know about SPR dynamics. Basically I applied myself to that problem and realized that really at the end of the day, being that I may essentially a privileged white guy in this world with surrounded by oodles of technology. I have an enormous opportunity to subvert my privilege if I can just understand what it is. I'm also on the autism spectrum and have suffered for many years from just thinking differently, according to the culture that we live in. Basically everybody on this call probably suffers in some way from that, regardless of who they are or what they look, because it's the nature of the culture itself. So my thought about what to do about that was that I basically needed to accept responsibility for this.  

(03:32)    
**Durgadas**:    Thus the name of the name of the book, which I'm basically gonna write on the BA on the back of this series of workshops that I hope to give. Additionally, I also started working with last year before the pandemic, the educational wing of couch and tribes to try to talk about workshops that we could put people through who wanted to have relationships with couch and tribes, to get them to understand what the actual underlying issue was. Also on top of that, there is this need to decolonize with respect to yoga, because yoga comes from India, which is a colonized country. There are a lot of issues with that. This thing has a fair number of slides.

(04:51)    
**Durgadas**:    The PowerPoint has a lot of additional resources, YouTube videos, to a lot of things that I'm gonna be talking about. A lot of other resources. I could've included a lot more, but this is basically two days work, so it will improve over time. My name's Regis Chapman, you can call me Durga dos. I spent 10 years building this building. You kind see behind me, it's all made outta mud and clay and straw and fantastic. I, so I'm also working with some of the other people on this call in various capacities, Sean, with his cryptocurrency company, grace, we're working together on trying to talk about autism together. So I'll just get started. 

## Divided vs Unified

### TWO WAYS TO THINK
**HOW HUMANS ARE HAVING *HUMAN EXPERIENCES* IN A TIMELESS, INFINITE, UNCHANGING REALITY**

[*WATCH: STROKE OF INSIGHT VIDEO*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyyjU8fzEYU)

#### DIVIDED
- Bicameral Brain, Left Side
- Serial Processor, Linear Thought
- PATTERNS, PAST, PROJECTIONS
- Language, Details & Differentiation
- Visual Processing Focused on objects
- CMYK Color Model produces Black
- Externalization of costs
- Ethics

[*WATCH: The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World*](https://youtu.be/SbUHxC4wiWk)

#### UNIFIED
- Bicameral Brain, Right Side
- Parallel Processor, Non-Linear Thought
- NOW, CONTEXT
- CANNOT differentiate
- Visual Processing focused on relationships
- RGB Color Model produces white
- Response-ability

Those of you who saw the video with Jill Bolty Taylor, hopefully it was inspiring for you. I want to speak about this from the perspective of Jill Bolte Taylors, two different ways to think. There's also a link to the stroke of insight video here. 

The divided mind basically thinks in terms of a serial processor with linear thought the right brain as functions, more like a parallel processor with non-linear thought the divided left brain thinks in terms of patterns past and projections, the unified mind on the right side thinks only in terms of now what the now looks like and smells like and tastes like. 

It is the ultimate co contextualize because it literally has no concept of the slightest amount of differences whatsoever. It can't even tell the difference between one thing and another, it only knows about the perpetual. Now the divided mind thinks in terms of language and details and differentiation and more details about all of this, the unified mind can't differentiate.  

As I mentioned before, visual processing of the divided mind, the left mind is focused a lot on objects. Visual processing on the right hemisphere of the brain is much more focused on relationships. We'll get into this more metaphorically. I've included this idea of the difference between the cm, Y K and RGB color models. 

For those of you who have any idea, what that is, the cm YK thing is basically an additive model or a it's added in terms of reflection, cm, YK produces black, whereas RGB monitors from the we're looking at all that in with respect to these monitors produces white. 

It's important to understand how those things work. The only difference between RGB and cm, Y K and the unified and divided mind is that the RGB and cm, Y K can be roughly considered to be a duality. 

Even though there are two ways to think the United unified and divided approaches to thinking should not, I repeat, *should not* be misunderstood as opposing things, the unified mind essentially swallows the entire divided way of thinking in its entirety.

It is the ultimate context in which the divided mind understands and projects itself. From, in terms of a metaphor, you could think about the divided mind is the movie projector, whereas the unified mind is the screen upon which that movie is projected. 

For example, if you project a violent movie with a lot of guns and John WIC activity there, the screen itself does not get full of holes, nor does it take any knife wounds or nor does it bleed. It is in many ways detached from the divided mine, and can't really be affected by that.  

Those of you're familiar with yoga and advice to Viant and other non-dual spiritual philosophies you'll understand that it is in fact, these contexts in which this bicameral mind is allowing us to lend the world. We'll speak about that quite a lot. 

I also put externalization of costs. One of the things that the divided mind will tend to do is to be in denial. It's also the thing, which is responsible for ethics. That is to say that, which concerns me, it's the in individual self. 

If I'm talking about myself in terms of a social context, my choices as relates to what I choose to connect with, for example, you all chose to show up into this group right now, your was your ethical choice to connect with this group and be engaged with this group. Whereas morality is much more of a social thing. 

Then the unified side, we've got responsibility. That is to say, because it is the ultimate co contextualize. It is the thing which gives us the ability to overcome all these divide, divided ways of thinking and generate abilities to respond to things in with detachment and understanding because the unified mind also doesn't have anything like memory it only knows about now. 

### CONTEXT: TWO SOCIAL FORMS
**HOW HUMANS ARE HAVING *SOCIAL EXPERIENCES* IN A TIMELESS, INFINITE, UNCHANGING REALITY**

#### DIVIDED
- Colonizer Worldviews dominate
- Unified Cultures are genocided and appropriated.
- Abrahamic Traditions Objectify Unity (“Sky Gods”)
- Merchants Assess Objects Using “Value” using highly objectified and technical languages like English and - accept only written texts as evidence.
- Creates Hierarchies By Default, Resulting In Violence, holarchies considered impossible.
- Visual Perception & Philosophy Emphasize Individuals & Reductionistic Approaches
- Psychological effects of cultural influences result in increasing narcissism and narcissistic abuse among participants over time.
- Good=Compliance, Evil=Non-Compliance To Social Contract/Hierarchy.

#### UNIFIED
- Pre-Colonization & Highly Unified Worldviews dominate
- Divided Cultures cannot survive and are absorbed through the sheer flexibility and resilience of the approach.
- Shamanic & Dharmic Traditions Contextualize Objects In A Totality
- Citizens Assess Objects in “Relative” ways using contextualized, oral traditions and sonically diverse languages.
- Creates & exists inside holarchies by default. Mechanisms (like the potlatch) exist to flatten the inevitable hierarchies that form.
- Visual Perception & Philosophy Emphasis Contextualizations At Every Level
- Psychological effects result in Overview Effect and relational thinking among participants over time.
- Good=Inclusive Thinking & Behavior, Evil=Exclusive Thinking & Behavior
- Morals

I divide up the social forms of colonizer thinking, basically the divided mind you've got, if you're ratifying and validating the divided mind, you're gonna end up with the colonizer worldview. On the other hand, before, when you had a world that was dominated by unified social forms, you could have somebody like genus con go blazing through your history and still recover from that because the unified worldviews were essentially the most common thing that existed.  

You can see that the divided cultures essentially can't survive for very long, unless they actually colonize really. There are many forms of colonization we'll talk about, but on the other hand, the divided cultures, unified cultures tend to be appropriated and treated poorly. 

Even to the degree, to which they're genocide, you can also take a look at it with respect to the compare and contrast between the divided Abrahamic traditions with their sky gods and the shamonic and dharmic traditions, which basically contextualize the earth, the sky, the universe, the planets, all those things in a totality, as opposed to just a bunch of different objects.

## Merchant Thinking

It's also true that the divided mind basically has been taken over by this merchant thinking. We basically assess objects in divided cultures in divided social forms, using this thing called value. Those values basically are, have to do with like a monetary exchange. 

For those of you who are dealing with things in terms of cryptocurrency and who have encountered me with respect to my perspective on cryptocurrencies, you'll see that what I'm attempting to do is relentlessly contextualize the nature of the work that we're doing in the cryptocurrency space, so that we don't make this a colonizer mistake and to bring forth the legacy code base, which is very much divided.  

### Language

The other thing is that the language itself is incredibly influenced by this merchant's assessing objects using value. It creates a highly technical language that is extremely appropriate for that type of that type of cultural context in which you would assess things like that to the degree, to which we even think of our own psychology and the words we use in our psychology and the entire way that psychology is constructed in our culture. 

I literally mean this from the entire history of psychiatry, and psychology in terms of value and worth. It's actually extraordinary. Once you, once, by the way, I'm just warning you that once you start to see this stuff, it's really difficult to unsee it. This is a bit like the matrix. I'm just warning you ahead of time.  

Juan Carlos gave me about many stories about the process of decolonization on the part of the hundred plus countries that declared independence days from various European colonies. I didn't include any of that later versions of this will include many links to that thing, but I'd just like you to understand that English in particular is a, is an extremely good language for technical topics and is extremely good for mercantilism and other things. Whereas things like Sanskrit are much better at things. In many ways you could think about it in terms of there's additional bifurcation in terms of language.  

It should be noted that Sanskrit is considered the world's most natural language, according to artificial intelligence research. 

## Hierarchy vs Wholarchy
For those of you who are in the crypto AI space, additionally, it, the divided mind tends to create hierarchies by default and basically wholarchies, which are talked about in the Aqua version of spiral dynamics of Ken Wilbur. 

They're largely considered to be impossible just because we've repeated this hierarchical way of thinking. Often that it's almost difficult to think of things in terms of anything other than a series of flatland hierarchical objects, the differentiation between the divided, the unified mine, culturally, cuz we're talking about social forms here.  

## Achieving Unified Thinking

If you read Jonathan hates book, for example, he actually speaks about this too. Even visual perception is affected by this and the inevitable results of carte and thinking for example, are even felt in Al and philosophies and other things. You can see that stuff really clearly. 

Then people who think about things in terms of a unified way of thinking, particularly in recolonized unified cultures, the psychological effect of thinking this way tends to result in inevitably in an overview effect, as opposed to narcissism, which is the inevitable outcome of the divided way of thinking.  

The overview effect you guys may or may not understand is something that is often experienced by astronauts who go up into space and realize that they're going around 19 times a day and everyone who's ever lived and all the drama and politics that have ever occurred. The entire of human history is all this, just this one unified ball. It's this one thing that tends to detach your mind from thinking about things in terms of the divided countries and things, and gives you this overview effect. 

It's possible to achieve that just with yoga and thinking about things relentlessly in terms of a unified approach. It also redefines the nature of good and evil. For example, in Hinduism, good and evil actually don't exist at all. There really just a way of thinking, good would be inclusive thinking and behavior evil is exclusive thinking and behavior, but even then the evil is explained away in terms of the good, the larger good, and so that you can actually see the cultural framework doesn't even accept this so-called classic philosophical problem of evil simply just doesn't exist.  

## Problem of Evil 

The idea that if there was a deity, how could a deity let so many horrible things happen? Well, I'm specifically telling you explicitly that the reason why bad things happen is because of this bifurcation and the cultural emphasis and imbalance that is present in our current culture. That should just be obvious just by watching current events, any questions on the social forum side of this picture?  

## Divided mind creates space for unified

(21:26)    
**Speaker 1**:    You were talking about earlier where like this unified consciousness actually explains a way that divided consciousness and even creates space for it.  

(21:46)    
**Durgadas**:    That's absolutely true. In fact it, what's more than that, it actually allows for the complexity of the divided to be discovered in this comprehensive manner. Right? The, even to the degree to which, and this is talked about maybe in the next slide where you can actually take a look at the intellectual approach. 

### CONTEXT: INTELLECTUAL APPROACHES
**HOW HUMANS ARE HAVING *PHILOSOPHICAL&PERCEPTUAL* EXPERIENCES IN A TIMELESS, INFINITE, UNCHANGING REALITY**

#### DIVIDED
- Educational system focused on external objects given positive value by the society, not the student nor the mind of the student; nor “Reality” itself.
- Materialistic Worldviews dominate (Science Delusion) and limit the available evidence, focusing on patho-myths and denialism.
- Objectivity and Subjectivity are misunderstood as “a very very very long list of objects” and individual perception is completely denied, dismissed and distrusted rather than understood.
- Unified Cultures are appropriated, demeaned and degraded, resulting in enormous misunderstandings and failure to benefit from the syncretic approach they possess. 
- Focus On “Being Right” within the hierarchy’s ‘value’ system. “Right” (according to the social contract) is PARAMOUNT ABOVE ALL ELSE. Therefore “beliefs” supersede all other rationality.
- Intellectuals Assess Concepts, Values, and Objects Using “Value”, based on the orthodoxy of their culture, resulting in an imbalance of thinking. Extending the senses is a primary means of knowledge.
- “Hard Sciences” preferred due to materialist bias, while psychology and even history are seen through the rigid orthodoxies that actively subvert and prevent their understanding.
- Visual Perception & Philosophy Emphasize Individuals & Reductionistic Approaches above all else: DESCARTES: “I think, therefore I am.”

#### UNIFIED
- Educational system focused on the student, and their mind’s ‘lensing’ of Reality and their roles within themselves, the family unit, the social fabric and the world and the universe itself; forming a cohesive approach to both inner and outer life.
- Mythologies are used as unified frameworks for imparting vast, complex and contextual understandings for multiple levels of learner development and maturity levels along the path to knowledge of all the roles an individual plays, as previously mentioned.
- The apparent division between Objectivity and Subjectivity in perception was solved thousands of years ago.
- Divided Cultures are understood to be immature expressions of a whole, even while suffering under the abuse they mete out.
- Subverting “belief” altogether is a primary means of knowledge. “The Knowledge That, Being Known, Nothing Else Remains To Know.”
- Intellectual activity is validated and contextualized in terms of being balanced between openness and discrimination.
- Creates & exists inside holarchies by default. 
- Visual Perception & Philosophy Emphasis Contextualizations At Every Level: Advaita Vedanta: “I Am, Therefore I Think”, since existence precedes Thought.

## Lord Ramma
The thing that I'm talking about here is that the word myth has been largely corrupted by the divided way of thinking and educational thinking. What mythologies actually are, is very much like spiral dynamics. You can think of, for example, this deity behind me, Lord Ramma. 

Lord Rama would be a framework upon which you can project an a truly staggering amount of complexity to the point of understanding astronomy psychology. It just goes on and on. Then the relationships between the different characters in these things also then elucidate other kinds of mythological relationships. This is true to a degree that it said that the Maha Brata contains every possible human experience.  

The largest book really in existence beyond that it is an oral tradition. If you carry this into the intellectual side of the picture, what you can see is in many ways, the approach of science on the left side. I've got some links to Rupert Sheldrake's science delusion, which talks about some of these things and his advice around approaches to unify science again. 

## Education focused on external objects

The educational system in the divided cultural context is exclusively focused on external objects.

There'll be links to Marshall Rosenberg's audio book. He actually speaks about how he went through like 20 plus years of including like a PhD. He was never once asked how he felt about participating in that system. Basically the thing that I'm attempting to show is that the educational system of the divided is one that has a giant hole in the middle. 

That giant hole in the middle is you. Whereas the educational system of a unified way of thinking is exclusively focused on the student and their mind's relationship with the external and how they have to play these different roles within their relationship with themselves. 

To understand their shadow selves and other things, how they have their relationship with their family unit, but the social fabric, the world itself, and then the larger diffuse mysterious universe.  

By paying attention to how the mind lenses reality one can actually gain an understanding, not only about the, a deeper understanding about the nature of the external reality that the divided mind's trying to talk to you about, but also about your relationship with it.  

## other assertions that the divided intellectual approach takes

There's also some other assertions that the divided intellectual approach takes. For example, they tend to completely distrust the mind and, to people like who's the well there's Richard Dawkins, but he has a, there's a magician guy in Britain. What's his name, Darren brown, who likes to show the fundamental problems with the perception. And that's the divided way of thinking. 

Whereas the unified mind solved the problem of objectivity and subjectivity several thousand years ago, we don't have to keep going on television to point out the fact that this subjectivity objectivity problem exists. We, and you can't actually solve these subjectivity objectivity issue with a divided form of thinking. It requires that you adopt and ratify a unified way of thinking. 

Additionally, the divided way of thinking has a crucial flaw in that what you believe is the primary thing your beliefs, it's gotten to the point, I've almost got 5,000 answers on core. At this point, it's gotten to the point where I won't even answer a question with the word belief in it. 

It doesn't make any sense at all, because I have a unified approach, which includes the unified and then divided, but I'm just tired of answering people whose minds are completely taken over by the divided. I would rather speak to people who have at least an inkling of the nature of the unified way of thinking. 

It's also true that divided cultures are understood by unified cultures as immature expressions of a whole, even while suffering under the abuse that the divided cultures have given out in the last thousand years. One of the primary approaches about unified knowledge is to subvert belief altogether.  

This is the primary means of knowledge for a unified thinker. There's a story about the traditional way to deal with the guru system is that a parent would send its their child a way to an ashram or to a local teacher at age eight. They would return at age 20. 

The real question, the only real question that needs to be answered by this student when they come back to their parents, is did you learn the knowledge that being known, nothing else remains to know. 

This is very clear evidence of a cultural, a framework, which sets up the unified approach to thinking versus being right adhering to a social contract, adhering to the various levels of hierarchy. Even with intellectuals, they assess concepts, values, and objects using this term value generally based on the orthodoxy of their culture, inevitably resulting in an imbalance of thinking.  

To the degree that scientists themselves tend to hard sciences versus psychology or like history it's unbelievable the degree to which history has been revised, not only due to the horrific nature of colonization, but also just everything else. Take a look at the pyramids. They used saws. There's no way to, what I'm saying?, sorry, that just happened. We've got this whole revisionist history that says that couldn't have happened. There's just, it's all about reductionist approaches, whereas the unified intellectual approach would prioritize contextualization above all other things and the whole Cartesian way of thinking. Therefore I am is actually seen correctly in non-dual Viant as I am first, therefore because existence precedes thought, and this is an incredibly important differentiation.  

### POST-TRUTH POST-RACE POST-COLONIZATION

> THE IRONY OF THE TITLE OF THIS PRESENTATION IS THAT NONE OF THESE TERMS ACTUALLY EXIST IN REALITY.
> 
> THIS INITIAL UNDERSTANDING(OR LACK THEREOF) WILL TYPICALLY BE INFORMED BY THE LEVEL OF PRIVILEGE OF THE PERCEIVER.
>
> WE WILL EXAMINE WHY THIS IS, NEXT.

(31:34)    
**Durgadas**:    Okay. I just wanted to point out the subtitle that I had here taking responsibility in a post-truth post-race post colonization era. Now it's interesting because those things don't actually exist. There is no such thing as a post-truth society. There's no such thing as post-race society, and there's no such thing as a post colonization society. 

All of those things continue to have huge imbalances. I put it in there because I wanted to see if anyone would notice and it's based on their basic perception of the world. And we're gonna get into that, the nature of privilege and other stuff in a bit, all of this comes down to, and this is my fundamental assertion with this entire topic. 

## THE LEGACY OF NARCISSISM

**ASSERTION**: COLONIZATION IS A WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL & GOVERNANCE-LEVEL EXPRESSION OF NARCISSISTIC ABUSE

> One can see this as the following approaches to recovery from Narcissistic Abuse are identical in approach, different in context:
> - A person escaping an abusive partner (intimate relationships)
> - A person recovering from being raised by a narcissist (family relationships)
> - Social justice movements
> - Environmentalist movements
> - Animal rights movements
> The MANY countries who have declared Independence Days from England and other European countries “World-wide, British Leaving Day is never out of season.” –Walter Russell Mead
> 
> It’s important to note that ALL co-opted institutions from such countries are conscripted to enforce this violent, exclusionary and often genocidal warfare to ensure compliance, and this is a feature of narcissistic abuse at every level of its expression from intimate relationships to the entire world. 
> 
> It is easy to see this just by looking at current events.

That is that all of these things are all of the reasons why all of this happens is because of this divided way of thinking, which has an inevitable outcome of narcissism. My assertion is that colonization is a worldwide financial and governance level expression of narcissistic abuse and narcissistic abusers.  

(33:03)    
**Durgadas**:    If you take a look at it in multiple context, you can talk about it from a person escaping an abusive partner in an intimate relationship, a person recovering like me from being raised by a narcissist social justice movements, environmentalist movements, even the cryptocurrency movement itself is an adaptive thing from the abuses of the financial system and the vast income inequalities and tying us to national currencies. 

Even Sean and I's work on with the spirit foundation is actually, it's an express thing to break off native cultures from their dependence on national currencies, which are fundamentally narcissistically abusive. One of the components of narcissistic abuse is financial abuse. Here we have it at the same time, I put in the thing about the independence days from England and other European countries worldwide, British leaving days, never out of season, there are something like a hun over a hundred of those throughout the world.  

(34:15)    
**Durgadas**:    And given that there's only 150 countries, you have to think that's a fairly extraordinary thing. Every single one of those countries has some story of the same story as a person escaping the abusive partner and even all these books that Juan Carlos talked to me about all the stuff we're doing in the gravity group with the tech thing about resolving labor disputes and on it's all because this entire structure is all based in this narcissistic abuse at multiple levels, financial, physical, everything. Just take a look at the contrast between the way black lives matters. Protests are treated versus a literal invasion of democracy. It's really easy to see the literal black sheep of this particular country is that so additionally, you can see that if you take a look at the way European cultures are set up, they're set up in these dynasties. Basically all Kings and Queens are all related to each other across hundreds of years in England and Germany and Netherlands and everywhere.  

### THE LEGACY OF NARCISSISM
- ASSERTION: COLONIZATION IS A WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL & GOVERNANCE-LEVEL EXPRESSION OF NARCISSISTIC ABUSE THAT PRODUCES FAMILY “DYNASTIES” BOUND TO ITS INFLUENCE.

![](https://i.imgur.com/WAq9csd.png)

(35:47)    
**Durgadas**:    And so given that all of these people are basically narcissists, what are they gonna do when they go out and colonize other cultures? They're gonna essentially reproduce that same thing. I would say that as an assertion, that colonization is a now normalized expression of narcissistic abuse. 

### THE LEGACY OF NARCISSISM

#### ASSERTION: COLONIZATION IS A NOW-NORMALIZED EXPRESSION OF NARCISSISTIC ABUSE

> [**VICTIMS OF NARCISSISTIC ABUSE**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_abuse): This Wikipedia article show the following effects, easily seen in modern society and the governed around the world, at all times, but particularly now. Some relevant excerpts from this article:
> 
> **SELF-STIGMA**: Self stigma is the process in which a person internalizes the stigma and stereotypes around them by applying them to the self. This can lead to problems with self-esteem, depression and identity.
> 
> Research has shown that the public is less likely to think individuals with personality disorders need professional help and instead hold the belief that those with personality disorders should be able to exhibit control over behaviours caused by said disorders, combined with the clinical belief that people with Narcissistic Personality Disorder are untreatable. Low public mental health literacy has been linked to low treatment-seeking from those suffering from disorders the sufferers themselves stigmatize. Narcissistic personality disorder has notably low treatment-seeking behaviour, most often seeking treatment for less stigmatized comorbid issues.
> 
> **MODERN THEORIES**: Current point of view of modern psychiatrists believe that today's society is at fault for the increase in narcissistic abuse because society promotes competitiveness. Many features of narcissism are sources of success in the modern competitive society. The question is that to what extent the opportunistic abilities to bring out one's own proficiency and constantly strive for the better result in trample on other people and having an irresponsible and insensitive attitude to other people (see e.g. Lucher, Huston, Walker & Alex Houtson, 2011).
> 
> In 2011 Maatta, Uusiautti & Matta published a study with an indication that modern society may shape the patterns of narcissistic abuse. The ideas of pleasing yourself first, taking care of yourself, climbing the ladder and general success in life are desired traits. And the explanation for the increase in narcissistic disorders may at least partly be found in the societal development as competitiveness, individualism, and opportunism are admired - those exact features that are often typical of narcissists.

There is a link in here to the Wikipedia article on narcissistic abuse, but two of the ones that I'd like to point out here, one is this self-stigma the problem with narcissistic abuse is that you basically stigmatize yourself and all of your strategies around your life tend to revolve around the strategies of the narcissist basically resulting in this duality of abuser and abused. 

When you do that for generations across multiple layers of aspects of human life, you're basically gonna end up with a culture which does that, and this modern theory here that you actually talk about is literally the, a psychological journal speaking about those tendencies directly. That's my evidence for that.  

#### ASSERTION: COLONIZATION IS A WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL & GOVERNANCE-LEVEL EXPRESSION OF NARCISSISTIC ABUSE

> [COMPONENTS OF NARCISSISTIC ABUSE](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/toxic-relationships/201709/how-spot-narcissistic-abuse): This Psychology Today article lists the following components, easily seen in modern society and governance around the world, at all times, but particularly now.
> - VERBAL ABUSE
> - MANIPULATION
> - EMOTIONAL BLACKMAIL
> - GASLIGHTING
> - COMPETITION
> - NEGATIVE CONTRASTING 
> - EXPLOITATION & OBJECTIFICATION 
> - SCAPEGOATING 
> - LYING
> - WITHOLDING
> - NEGLECT
> - PRIVACY INVASTION
> - CHARACTER ASSASSINATION/SLANDER
> - VIOLENCE
> - FINANCIAL ABUSE
> - ISOLATION
> Quoting the same article: “Malignant Narcissism and SociopathySomeone with more narcissistic traits who behaves in a malicious, hostile manner is considered to have “malignant narcissism.” Malignant narcissists aren’t bothered by guilt. They can be sadistic and take pleasure in inflicting pain. They can be so competitive and unprincipled that they engage in anti-social behavior. [Paranoia](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/basics/fear) puts them in a defensive-attack mode as a means of self-protection.”

**Durgadas**:    You can also see all of these things pretty obviously in the news right now, Trumpism is essentially that, and there's look, there was 75 million people that voted for that guy. You have to think that there was a bunch of those folks who are narcissists and they had to come from somewhere. There it is. I'm not gonna spend any time on this, cuz it's a little too small, but this basically speaks about the cycle so that you guys can have a look at this. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/avY0FMy.png)

A lot of times this is put in terms of relationships, individuals, but I'm basically generalizing it to society. Where do we end up with this? This is basically living a huge cult. That's the entire point of this is. I said to you guys that there's gonna be some unpleasant truths here, but this is really true. 

The thing is that what's important to me is to find a unified theory about how all these divisions work. It's not, it's not okay. For example, for me to come up with something like critical race theory, where I imagine that my race is the single most important aspect of my existence. When in fact the thing that's more fundamental is my mode of thinking. If I'm thinking in terms of divided nature, then I'm gonna tend to abuse people on the basis of surface things and therefore to a person who's being abused. It might seem that the pretext upon which that abuse is given to them is the single most important thing.  

### THE PEDAGOGY OF CULTS
**COLONIZED HUMANS ARE ESSENTIALLY TAUGHT TO OBJECTIFY THEMSELVES AND EVERYTHING ELSE, WITH THEIR PSYCHOLOGY DEFINED AS ‘OBJECTS OF GREATER OR LESSER VALUE’ BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE PRIVILEGE AND SOCIAL STATUS IN AN INTERLOCKING WORLDWIDE SYSTEM OF ABUSE.**
> This is the basis of all the biases, prejudices and negative –isms like racism, sexism, trans-phobia or people who just lack compliance in the social contract in ANY form at all. 
> 
> Since our culture’s primary expression of “culture” is a relentless drive toward creating objects of all types, it is extremely adept at appropriation as well, since appropriation is the literal aim of ALL colonization strategies. Every type of violence is authorized in the acquisition of valuable objects, by every hierarchical layer. 
> 
> Similarly, every type of violence is authorized in the pursuit of maintaining the rigid orthodoxies required by narcissists. This is very similar to the behavior of cults, and it’s true our society has “cult behavior” as an almost-ideal compliance mechanism.
> 
> Since abuse is narcissistic by its nature, requiring the “othering” of one object in favor of another (usually one’s identified egoic self, created, educated and maintained by the culture), then one can see it isn’t far from that to violence to ensure compliance to the hierarchy.

(38:59)    
**Durgadas**:    But in fact, it has a deeper aspect to it. Part of the reason why I'm bringing all this stuff up is that every single person in this room has some experience with that or another. It's incredibly important to root that out within yourself to decolonize yourself from within, but also to understand what you're going to encounter out into the, out in the world. 

I've included a couple of links to videos about what it's like to have a family cult. The one I grew up in, or the one that all of the Trump kids are in, for example, I have a lot of compassion for them because they're just in the bubble and they can't get out of it. I've got a whole bunch of family members who are trapped in the same bubble.  

Every time I go back, I have to steal myself and try to imagine that I'm gonna be able to be a compassionate voice for the suffering that they're going through on the basis of that. 

### THE PATHOLOGY OF PRIVILEGE
**COLONIZED HUMANS OPERATE IN A SEVERELY LIMITED AND HOLLOW SELF-UNDERSTANDING DUE TO THE GENERATIONAL ABUSE BY THE ENTIRE CULTURE SO PERVASIVE THEY CAN NO LONGER PERCEIVE IT OR SUBVERT IT.**
> Privilege is a state of denial of Reality, combined with a social contract that says the ‘privileged’ will never be made to feel the actual consequences of their attitudes, ignorance, bias or actions. 
> 
> Such a psychological state can ONLY exist inside a systemic structure completely defined by abuse, in which a relatively lessened state of abuse is configured hierarchically so that one perpetually “fights” for a higher ‘privilege’ status, which is essentially permission to exist in the false duality of “abuser” and “abused” from one hierarchical step to another; granting ‘permission’ to the higher status for more ability to abuse and lessening of the expectation of receiving abuse or accountability. 
> 
> So it is seen that in such a system, defining and naming and assessing the various overlapping hierarchies is primary work in the mind of its participants; making it difficult for anyone to spend time considering or even knowing of the existence of non-hierarchies or even just gaps between hierarchies. 
> 
Even our feeling of restriction based on these hierarchical systems is given an outlet in the form of yet another hierarchy, to the degree that even a super-rich ultra-privileged person continues to feel like an oppressed underdog and whose only approved cultural method of coping is to overcompensate with ego.

> [Tim Wise’s 2016 Youtube Video On A Race-Focused View Of The Pathology Of Privilege](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O81L6JRcGYw)
> 
> Notable Mentions from the video: “Journal Of The American Medical Journal found that Americans have twice the incidence of anxiety disorders above the global average and 5 TIMES that of Nigeria, which is almost constantly war-torn?” PRIVILEGE BLINDS US TO REALITY and so makes us anxious, since at SOME level we know we’re in a culture predicated on Narcissistic Abuse.

Colonized humans basically operate in this limited and hollow self understanding like we talked about before due to the generational abuse, by the entire culture that is so pervasive that they can no longer perceive it or work to subvert. 

It basically privileges is a state of denial of reality with a social contract set up by narcissist that says that the person who's privilege will never be made to feel the actual consequences of their attitudes, bias or actions. This right here is the basis for almost every successful company on wall street today. 

If you take a look at Walmart, th that right there is the literal business plan of Walmart. They externalize all their costs onto everyone else. The most successful companies on wall street today, do exactly the same thing. Now, this privilege look can actually only exist. If you think about it inside a systemic structure that is completely, totally defined by abuse in which a relatively less state of abuse is configured hierarchically. 

That one perpetually fights for a higher privileged status to expect less abuse in one way or the other, and the privilege to abuse those who are lower than you. What you can see from this is that defining and naming and assessing various overlapping hierarchies is the primary work of our own minds. 

If I'm talking to you guys right now, I'm talking to you guys all have jobs, and you're all dealing with things. Some of you may be constructing and participating in hierarchical situations. You might wanna be aware of just how pervasive the hierarchical way of thinking is in the culture.  

(42:09)    
**Durgadas**:    Tim wise has a great YouTube videos. My favorite YouTube video on how privileged blinds us and the notable mention that I'll have from this is that the journal of American medical association found that Americans have twice the incidence of anxiety disorders above the global average and five times that of Nigeria, which is almost constantly at war or having civil war or doing other things. Now, what culture is it that would make it, so that even a comp a constructionally in the middle of war would have less anxiety than we do. I, there's just something really wrong with that. I feel like I'm risking pointing out all of this bad news to everybody just so that we can correctly diagnose the problem, because if we don't know the problem exists, then we cannot be aware of it and we can't figure out what to do about it. We're gonna get into strategies about what to do about it in a bit, but I did wanna make sure that we are taking a look at the difficulty of it. That was a bit of a difficult section there. Anybody have questions about any of that stuff?  

### THE PEDAGOGY OF FREEDOM
DE COLONIZED HUMANS ARE ESSENTIALLY TAUGHT TO CONTEXTUALIZE THEMSELVES AND EVERYTHING ELSE WITHIN THEIR PSYCHOLOGY DEFINED AS 'OBJECTS IN RELATIONSHIP TO A WHOLENESS' BASED ON THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR BALANCED APPROACH TO THEIR MINDS 

**THE REAL HISTORY LESSON**: This is important because one must RESEARCH IT to find it out, and most importantly STOP DENIAL. The combination of gaslighting, manipulation and withholding information will create a personal tendency to follow the general culture’s approach to this deep denial also.
**SELF-COMPASSION**: In order to extend compassion to others, one MUST be willing to extend it toward one’s self, and to do so actively and with intention and determination, ESPECIALLY WHEN society or others in your social group are unwilling to.
**NON-VIOLENT COMMUNICATION (NVC)**: (SEE GRAPHIC NEXT PAGE) Leads to the understanding of feelings and their link to needs, as well as how to communicate in a healthy way through observations and requests vs. judgements & demands. Communicate in ways that serve life and avoid the creation of enemy images.
**SPIRAL DYNAMICS**: Grave's work was later extended into AQAL (SEE GRAPHIC IN FOLLOWIN PAGES) by Ken Wilber, into a literal Theory Of Everything. For me, one of the main benefits of this approach is a way to extend the fundamental idea from NVC of Not Creating Enemy Images Out Of Anyone by showing how each person is coming from their own line, state or type of developmental perspective.
**ANCIENT WISDOM TRADITIONS**: As we will see later. Ancient Wisdom Traditions outlined a way to become free, but all spiritual and religious traditions were well-establisehd PRIOR to the worldwide coloniztion problem, and so their approaches can often lead to a spiritual narcissim, instead of freedom, as well as any number of other cul-de-sacs of thinking. This is largely due to the fact that these traditional practcioners have been systematically destroyed.

What I'd like to do is go into a thing about how, what can we can actually do about this. And the very first thing that we have to basically do is to be willing to look at those things and to get the history lesson. The difficulty is that because it's narcissistic abuse, as I mentioned in the previous slides, one of the, one of the fundamental aspects of this is manipulation, gas, lighting control and all these things.  

(44:50)    
**Durgadas**:    You're gonna have a difficult time finding the real history lesson, unless you go looking for it. The reason why we have so much anxiety and so much depression is because the culture basically teaches that we're supposed to be in denial of all these things. 

We're supposed to forget about the fact that we bombed an entire town of rich black people out of existence in Tulsa, Oklahoma in the early 19 hundreds with we'd never done that in the entirety history of our country, but we'd literally bombed them with bombers that had been used in the first world war. 

It doesn't, but many people don't even know that exists. In order to be able to get better and to get over depression, get over anxiety, you actually have to be able to be willing to look at that from a personal standpoint and from a societal standpoint. To do that, you have to come equipped with self-compassion self-compassion dot org is really great to resource for people who are struggling with that. 

More than that, in order to extend compassion to others, which is by the way, a tonic against narcissism, one must be willing to extend it to yourself. This is the most important thing, and you need to be able to do it with quite some resolve and determination because society is typically not going to provide you with that feedback. 

I'd would suggest that you guys to find a way to create, self-compassion go to self-compassion dot org or to engage with nonviolent communication and or spiral dynamics and spiral dynamics becomes a lot more rich when you take a look at it in terms of nonviolent communication first, because one of the main precepts of nonviolent communication is to prevent people from creating enemy images out of each other.  

Whether I'm a man or a woman or a trans person, or a black person or a brown person, or a person who speaks your language, or doesn't who looks differently, who thinks differently, who's an introvert or an extrovert. None of those things really matter to a person who thinks in a unified way. It seems to me that nonviolent communication is a method by which you can figure out how to get from the divided cultural context over to the unified cultural context. 

Spiral dynamics is a really deep way to do that because instead of imagining that Billy Joe, Jim Bob is behaving in a certain way, because they're a jerk, you can say, maybe they're coming from this red perspective. That they grew up in a, in this cultural context that doesn't help them to understand how these things work. 

Then you can give them tools and come to some level of compassion, presuming that you've spent enough time to create compassion within yourself. Additionally, ancient wisdom traditions actually outlined a way to become free and to in new what the potential harm that could exist with respect to this divided way of thinking. 

They made a rational choice to create their entire culture around a setup that thought about things in terms of unified ways of thinking. Now we don't live in a society like that. Moreover, we basically went out and killed 90% of the people on the planet who thought like that. It's extremely difficult to get back to that now.  

## Question
(49:02)    
**Speaker 1**:    Number one, how did we digress or rather, yeah. How did one part of the world not spread that? And essentially this divided thinking, how was that born? And so much of the world was the operating this unified thinking?  

The second part is how do, if we are theoretically, do, would we do get to a place where we are in that unified place? How do we defend against divided thinking?  

(49:35)    
**Durgadas**:    Well, see, and I would say that the thing that we're doing right now. We're gathering up in a group where we're all in different countries, we all live in different place. What I'm saying?, there's a bunch of us here from Canada, but there's, you're in, you're in Columbia now. I don't know where Chris is, but we, it doesn't really matter where we are. We're, we're basically, we have like a virtual unification, which is occurring in this very context. Right. It always starts like that. Right. Then this colonization legacy code base tends to turn on and start to then like it did with the web, for example, and it did with the internet itself where he just bought up all the lines and then everything gradually becomes centered.  

(50:24)    
**Durgadas**:    The same thing with the news media. Right? The point about this is that you have to be aware of the problems that can occur. You have to be aware of how bad that it can get genocides fairly horrible. Seems like the it's a small price for us to pay, to teach each other, how to be aware of the divided way of thinking that inevitably leads to this thing. Right. It leads to it all the time, everywhere, even when we're, when we're not conscious of it, because the culture is working on us in so many different ways, so often to make that happen. For me, the nature of spirituality is it, we have to understand what the underlying spiritual stuff is, how the mind works and all this, but then to figure out a way to choose that Jill Bolte, Taylor was staying at the very end of the video which one of those things do you choose and when, and if all your education has taught you is that you should ignore yourself and pay attention to what your culture prioritizes on your behalf.  

(51:49)    
**Durgadas**:    That itself is fundamentally narcissistic abuse. That's what it is just that right there, the fact that you don't matter and is reinforced by the overall culture. 

## Durgadas Story
What you basically have to do is in my case, I was offered a physics scholarship to Notre Dame when I came out of high school. 

I had been bullied for so long, by so many different people in so many different schools, I just said, I can't possibly ever go to another school. The physics professor himself was gonna pay for my education. I don't know if you understand how much money that is even back in the eighties, but that's hundreds of thousands of dollars to go to an Ivy league school Notre Dame. Right. 

He was gonna pay that because he talked to me on the phone for 15 minutes. Why didn't I wanna do that? That's because I understood that there was something that was really wrong with the educational system. I couldn't put myself into that situation. 

put myself into that situation again and continue to be bullied and continue to be worked on by this thing. What did i do is i came out of that and i found that i could be a lifelong learner and then i could validate myself and then i could i could figure out who i was. 

That continued right up until i was 32 years old when i decided i was going to leave my my father's uh strategy to become rich and suddenly uh uh leave silicon valley and stop working 100 hours a week to uh try to to get the brass ring and instead i was going to go and learn myself and what happened to me was that i just became very sick of myself i became very sick of the entire the entire load it just felt like the whole culture was just kind of crapping on me the whole time and i just didn't know myself enough to be able to to turn and face it and to be able to understand what was going on 

that's why self-knowledge is so important that's why self-compassion is so important that's why being able to turn and face and look at this stuff and you can't do it unless you know who you are and that's why over and over if you look at all of my quora answers i say find a teacher learn yourself and let me know if i can help those are the three things that i always talk about and self-knowledge is the single most important thing in life and it will
always be that way so i hope that answers your question

go ahead yeah i was i was going to say um like if if we are in that unified
place you know we're kind of accepting of pretty much everybody
and it almost seems like that is the perfect breeding grounds for narcissism to take place
yes that actually um is going to come up in in a little bit here um uh uh so what you're talking about
now is spiritual bypassing and spiritual narcissism and uh and we'll actually get into that
in a little bit so um just just to be clear the word spirituality means unified
thinking that's all it is that's all it is that's all it is it's all it will ever be there's never been anything else it's
just that so if somebody says i'm a spiritual person um then that means that they're trying to
validate this unified thinking but they might not be doing it in the smartest way
but we'll get into some of the problems of that um pre-trans fallacy is part of it too
so so i've actually included it in the slides too and ken wilbur talked about it as well um
i'm just putting this uh thing up here because this oftener flow chart is really really good for
nonviolent communication i've also included some additional links to the animated summary of the nbc book if
you need like a strunk and white version of that the cup of empathy youtube channel tons of videos in there
uh all based in nonviolent communication marshall rosenberg's own nonviolent
training course and his complete nvc audiobook with five hours of nbc
i've listened to that uh probably uh 20 times it's a really really good thing
so uh there's some resources for you guys on nvc and so let's talk about uh subverting
the the privilege here so as a as a white guy you know my job is to subvert
my own privilege understand what it is and i'm comparing and contrasting these and
i don't want to go down through all of this stuff but there are ways to kind of sort of do the
nonviolent communication thing wrong um so you basically instead of observing without evaluating you put in
you know uh value judgments and evaluations um to confuse uh feelings with
moralistic judgments so like a lot of times what people will do is uh instead of saying a feeling they'll
say i feel like you're doing this or that or the other thing and
that's actually not a feeling that's just you up in your head thinking about what the other person is
judging you for so i'm not going to go into this too
much because i've kind of already done this but
this is a thing you guys might have already seen around spirodynamics and a call uh it's in here for reference uh these
are the big versions of these two by the way so if you don't have these graphics you can
use them elsewhere same thing with here
sean and i and the folks in the cryptocurrency space are talking about this a lot so we can actually
focus our company in these ways too but you can apply it to a lot of
different uh situations so one of my favorite things that i
learned early on in my life is from this book the prophet um
the reason why i'm sort of stopping with this now is because i feel like you know if we're going to help other
people um it's not really the difference you can see the divided
uh inside of this quote and then you can see the unified in the quote this is one of the great things about the book the prophet is each
chapter is actually about figuring out how to um to take the divided and
transcend and include it in in that sort of uh ken wilburish way and turn it into a unified way of
thinking again right so
this is the uh thing i was talking to you about these divided strategies actually all come from
a um from a website called decolonizing yoga
which i'll link to later on um i've seen this happen a lot
in fact it's it's incredibly prevalent this
divided strategy where you take a unified strategy and kind of add ego and ignorance to it so
uh rather than um you know choosing to be silent about something that's going on
like for example my own guru swami vishnu devananda
was he's been dead for a while now but we just recently learned that he was
sexually abusing somebody that was just brutal for me because i lived my i lived for five years of my
life according to the to the the information that guy gave me with
insider an ashram filled with his devotees so it was incredibly challenging for me
to uh to uh accept that that was the truth and um nonetheless uh you know when
we're talking uh before tiffany we're talking about um integral leadership uh what i'm trying
to actually do this this uh presentation here is my attempt at integral leadership it's
literally about taking a hard look at the difficult things that exist
and figuring out how we can create strategies around those things so
if you take a look at the spiritual communities now you can actually see all of these divided strategies
existing right um sending love and light you know uh so you don't actually have to um to
be active or take direct action in any way um so you don't have to feel any
consequences of direct action keeping your vibration high that's basically encouraging numbness and
denial emphasizing the spiritual perspective that's essentially
you know victim blaming you know negating reality uh privileged preaching
is the same kind of thing um entitlement as the way a lot of times you'll see this
stuff like this crap like the secret and other things it's essentially just new age prosperity
gospel like the uh like the seed money that uh these um like these uh
televangelists will talk about like if you send a hundred dollars now then that will explode in your life and
there's just tons of that kind of crap that exists in our new age stuff and if you actually take a look at
the history of it a lot of it comes from theosophy i mean okay let's just talk about theosophy for
a second it's literally this white person that went over to india was like wow indian
philosophy is amazing and then they saw this dude on the beach with his brother one day and they picked
him up said you're going to be the next jesus took them off and trained him
at uh oxford and he became uh judo krishnamurti and
when they gave him the power over over the group they had created for his his world teaching the very first thing
is he did is he disbanded all of it because he was aware of the problems of all this divided strategy stuff
on the left side and it just repeats itself over and over and over again this colonizer thinking goes on and on
and on and on and you always have people trying to do this kind of thing and even if you go to india you'll see
some dude sitting on a on a thing with his arm up in the air it's like i've had my arm up
in the air for seven years well guess what he he can't bring his arm down now because his whole arm is
ossified and the whole thing's turned into bone because he hasn't used his arm for a long time so
it's no longer some kind of feature it's it's a medical problem that you have to break his arm just to
fix so it's not like you've got some spiritual
advancement there just because you had control of your okay that lasted for about a year but
now he literally couldn't drop his arm down if he wanted to so
i mean so you know the the divided strategies there are a lot of a lot of people uh trying to take your
money and and and the fact years and all all these people for years and years and years
this always tried to happen it's just super important to recognize it in its different forms and it's what
i'm hoping is that you guys will come away with this thing where you can't really unsee this anymore like you can see
you can see into the the the problems that can occur because they
just happen again and again and again and it's just cyclical all the time right so
uh that's all colonization is is is a domination of an entire cultural worldview based on
on basically invading and genociding and co-opting and appropriating uh culture that uh
is now dominating the planet and and i i would say that the work that we're doing with crypto and and
and all these social justice movements and all these different things are all about trying to reunify you know
uh the work grace and i are doing about trying to educate people about autism and and and you know that's another way to
unify so that we're not constantly thought about as um as i mean i've literally been called
uh a you know in the past so i mean it's just think about it it's
all this same stuff it just happens over and over again and these just different forms but we're so gaslighted that we can't we
can't parse out this stuff anymore and so what i'm trying to do is give you guys an accounting of how this works
and a way to um to find unified strategies that can can subvert
these so this comes down basically to the
psychology um ken wilber talks about a lot of this stuff too
the uh the wake up grow up clean up open up and show up is all in here
and there are various uh sort of skills inside of this which can be
which is part of the the that that integral process but this is a much clearer way of
showing it and it's not showing this according to the overall aqua model but
um i couldn't really find one um that that did a good job uh i couldn't find really a graphic that
did a good job of uh including all those different layers uh with the spiral aspects of it but it
should be clear enough i think uh you know from this and and there are
smaller resolution versions of this these things that all um fit into the aqua model but i just
couldn't find it in time so um but yeah this is the this is the
decolonization um uh you know toolbox right here
this uh scene in terms of the the spiral dynamics and aqua models
um these things have to be done because they're more prevalent um in here and this actually brings up
an entire um aspect of um the nature of colonization
that it should be known that the narcissistic abuse the colonization
approach to everything is intentionally keeping you asleep
instead of waking you up is intentionally keeping you immature so for example if
somebody comes to you in some religious context and says you just need to believe you know you
just need to have faith that is literally postponing your own spiritual maturity
because all you have to do is believe so you don't need to grow up you don't
need to mature at all you don't need to face difficulties you don't need to look at anything so cleaning up is also your own self
taking responsibility the the title of this entire presentation is uh is taking responsibility in in the
post-truth post race post-colonization world so this cleanup thing is you
communicating authentically constructively negotiating and
coordinating now opening up dare without knowing transformative drop the mask that's another part so
stop hiding as a person on the autism spectrum it's incredibly difficult to drop the mask because you're basically trained
to mask all the time and masking itself is a part of the narcissistic abuse of
the culture why would a culture ask me to not be who i am unless it
didn't like who i was and was asking me not to do it and what you'll notice is that the
narcissist does one primary thing and that's scapegoating you can see this from donald trump's
involvement and everything but that's just typical of all narcissism you can't open
up if someone scapegoated you into hiding for your whole life so now you
have to figure out how to drop the mask and then showing up you can't show up
look at all of us in this thing look at all the people in the tech community these people are all showing up
right doing the work doing the difficult stuff you can't do that if you're still hiding
from yourself or hiding from others or just sitting around with depression and you can't figure out
what to do about any of it if everywhere you go in the culture prevents you from being authentically
yourself why would you want to show up
so i'm basically saying that we need to assert our right to understanding and
what this graphic actually shows is what's called the anatomy of a mistake or what i call the anatomy of this
mistake in in hindu thinking there are three different
aspects of what's called maya or the illusion of life one is the veiling power of the mind or
the denial part of the mind its color is black and then the projecting power of the
mind so what you can see is these kind of balls in the middle is what's called the
tossing of the mind that swings back and forth like a pendulum on a clock between
the veiling and projecting parts of the mind this is called vicshipa and as you progress
and you gradually learn things and you implement these yogic principles
like contentment and dispassion and other things you can progress toward the revealing power of the mind
which is always present but can be overshadowed by the these two
things are the left brain functions this is the right brain function here
okay so the single most important thing to kind of know is
how the mind is lensing and this is the map of that lens and how is it that we're
constantly making the mistake of thinking and ratifying the divided side of our minds when you can
clearly show from from a sort of psychic anatomy perspective why that doesn't work
by the way this is a graphic i design additionally even scientific inquiry
suffers from this kind of uh problem and that is to say um uh and rupert
sheldrick has a great uh talk on this called the science delusion where he um
speaks about uh how science is kind of ossified into this uh rigid orthodoxy and he's trying to find
a way to allow for more free inquiry um and it's our right to understand both
ourselves and the external world congruently and if somebody suddenly stops
allowing you to accept certain things as evidence for example anybody here done any kind of
psychotropic drugs like mushrooms or lsd or or
neurotropics or any of those things how many so i i guess
my point here
sorry somebody else will holcomb is saying there were insufficient calories per
capita produced before 1968. systems that grew up in that environment had to be more brutal than
those can exist in our post-scarcity world to call the systems abusive dehumanizes
the perpetrators of the system as being an enemy rather than simply largely just the inheritance of a harder world
okay that seems like a reductionist approach to me in the sense that to reduce all of human
endeavor down to the pursuit of calories would be a a bit of a
yeah that would be an oversimplification but i'd be willing to entertain uh what you mean with respect to to
economics um that's also true that
uh those calories are not uh distributed uh equally around the
world nor are they now um so uh yeah i would i would have
a little bit of issue with what you're talking about in that sense but uh let's uh somebody want to say
something about that will do you have a comment well the reason that i bring up the kilocalories
is that before 1968 there was no solution like it was impossible for everyone to
eat before then after that point there's at least a possible solution to the problem
i think that fundamentally changes the types of systems that can be developed yeah well i mean if you're going to talk
about calories we could also talk about how uh both mccauley and
and uh um um
winston churchill artificially um screwed up farming in india and starved
literally millions of people while continuing to you know
rebuild their own countries so i mean there's an awful there's an awful lot of uh so i hear
what you're saying but it to say that that the entire world maybe didn't have enough calories until 1968
that's true but uh it's also true that uh these colonizer systems um ensured that those calories were
extremely unevenly distributed and continue to do so just like it does with uh with money and
everything else and it's all based on this divided way of thinking because a person a brown person in india has
less intrinsic value than a a a fat winston churchill so that's the fundamental thing if they
had really cared about people and they had a unified approach to to thinking then they would have um
they would have done something differently around that and so um and this is the actual problem that
uh for example sean and his whole uh group in ltf is attempting to address with respect to
native populations with spirit coin because the uh the nature of of national currencies for example uh
inordinately privileges uh the colonizer and literally cuts out the uh native
populations from being able to take advantage of all of the overlapping benefits
that those currencies provide to them so it's the uneven distribution uh of those
things which um the divided uh mind artificially uh creates and restricts uh
so what you're basically saying is uh is sort of a validation of my my approach here not necessarily uh
uh one uh that sort of uh inhibits it but i understand your point uh about that but i'm just saying that
that that all you could take you could pick anything gold calories whatever it would be
artificially restricted on the basis of um uh people with more
or less value and that's a global phenomenon chris you have something to say
i i would go so far to say as that the lack of solution for um
you know the calorie problem is more of a symptom of the colonial thinking than it
is the cause for sure yeah because what we're gonna what what what those um colonizer
cultures are gonna tend to do is let's say i'm going to invade a place and i'm going to go well what i'm here looking for is
gold people to do the work because i'm not going to do it and essentially women
to pleasure myself with and what else oh yeah there we discovered some other stuff um
and we'll just sort of take all that aggregate all that wealth and uh send it back to to good old
england and you know we still have financial systems that do the same thing um every single one of us here probably
work in some degree or another in a way that would aggregate wealth for billionaires so
50 50 60 of us in this room right now currently do that
kind of work this is this is still happening a lot with the american institution as well absolutely and so
yeah so it's this this uneven distribution uh it is itself violence you know
okay so um yeah the so it doesn't matter that millions of uh well i mean if you take a look now um
narendra modi um basically is um doing his own winston churchill he just
basically said yes monsanto now every single uh farmer in india has
to have monsanto wheat and so they're they're
you
