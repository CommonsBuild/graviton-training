## What is Conflict?

* [The Orange Story](http://www.mediationtools.com/articles/smbj9605.html) By Lee Jay Berman
  > In our society, we are raised to think that when there is a conflict, one person has to win and the other has to lose. We are not accustomed to working out win-win solutions. It is harder to do. It requires more effort. The outcome, however, is worth it. By working together, cooperatively and collaboratively, we can come up with better solutions, whether in parenting, in employment settings, in business transactions or even in lawsuits.

## Lederach - Conflict Transformation

**1. J. Paul Lederach, [little book of conflict transformation](https://professorbellreadings.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/the-little-books-of-justice-peacebuilding-john-lederach-the-little-book-of-conflict-transformation-good-books-2014-1.pdf)**

> As a starting point, let us explore the differences between the terms look and see. To look is to draw attention or to pay attention to something. In everyday language we often say, “Would you look over here please!” or “Look at that!” In other words, looking requires lenses that draw attention and help us become aware. To see, on the other hand, is to look beyond and deeper. Seeing seeks insight and understanding. In everyday language we say, “Do you see what I mean?” Understanding is the process of creating meaning. Meaning requires that we bring something into sharper focus.
> 
> **Conflict transformation is a way of looking as well as seeing.**
> 
> Conflict transformation is more than a set of specific techniques; it is a way of looking as well as seeing. Looking and seeing both require lenses. So conflict transformation suggests a set of lenses through which we view social conflict.

#### Conflict is... (_according to J.P Lederach_)
* Conflict can be understood as *that which keeps relationships and social structures honest, alive, and dynamically responsive to human needs*, aspirations, and growth.
* Conflict flows from life. Rather than seeing conflict as a threat, we can understand it as providing opportunities to grow and increase our understanding of ourselves, of others, and of our social structures. 
* Conflicts in relationships at all levels are the way life helps us to stop, assess, and take notice. 
* One way to truly know our humanness is to recognize the gift of conflict in our lives. *Without it, life would be a monotonously flat topography of sameness and our relationships would be woefully superficial.* 
* Conflict also creates life: through conflict we respond, innovate, and change.

### Transformative approach to conflicts
* Conflict is an opportunity, a gift. Conflict is normal in human relationships, and conflict is a motor of change.
* Rather than seeing peace as a static “end-state, ” conflict transformation views peace as a continuously evolving and developing quality of relationship.
* Conflict transformation is to envision and respond to the ebb and flow of social conflict as life-giving opportunities for creating constructive change processes that reduce violence, increase justice in direct interaction and social structures, and respond to real-life problems in human relationships.
* Transformation’s guiding question is this: How do we end something not desired and build something we do desire?

**2. Lederach Summary: [Conflict Transformation](http://peacebuildingforlanguagelearners.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/73426925/Lederach) By John Paul Lederach , Michelle Maiese**

> *what are useful lenses* that bring varying aspects of conflict complexity into focus and at the same time create a picture of the whole? *This essay will suggest three*.
> 
> **First**, we need a lens to see the immediate situation.
> **Second**, we need a lens to see past the immediate problems and view the deeper relationship patterns that form the context of the conflict. This goes beyond finding a quick solution to the problem at hand, and seeks to address what is happening in human relationships at a deeper level.
> **Third**, we need a lens that helps us envision a framework that holds these together and creates a platform to address the content, the context, and the structure of the relationship. From this platform, parties can begin to find creative responses and solutions.

## Antifragile, Nassim Nicholas Taleb

> “Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. Let us call it antifragile. 

> Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better. *This property is behind everything that has changed with time: evolution, culture, ideas, revolutions, political systems, technological innovation, cultural and economic success, corporate survival, good recipes, the rise of cities, cultures, legal systems, equatorial forests, bacterial resistance ... even our own existence as a species on this planet.* And antifragility determines the boundary between what is living and organic (or complex), say, the human body, and what is inert, say, a physical object like the stapler on your desk.”


**5. Taleb, [Antifragile. Things that gain from disorder](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KiuG5ye52VikNqPPBCvm2D0AxvcJBNrm/view?usp=sharing)**

> The antifragile loves randomness and uncertainty, which also means—crucially—a love of errors, a certain class of errors. Antifragility has a singular property of allowing us to deal with the unknown, to do things without understanding them—and do them well. Let me be more aggressive: we are largely better at doing than we are at thinking, thanks to antifragility. I’d rather be dumb and antifragile than extremely smart and fragile, any time.
> 
> It is easy to see things around us that like a measure of stressors and volatility: economic systems, your body, your nutrition (diabetes and many similar modern ailments seem to be associated with a lack of randomness in feeding and the absence of the stressor of occasional starvation), your psyche. There are even financial contracts that are antifragile: they are explicitly designed to benefit from market volatility.
> 
> Antifragility makes us understand fragility better. Just as we cannot improve health without reducing disease, or increase wealth without first decreasing losses, antifragility and fragility are degrees on a spectrum.

#### Antifragile and conflicts / Breaking points

![](https://i.imgur.com/zFjwZZ2.png)

**6. (Video) [Antifragile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3REdLZ8Xis)**

> There are things that don't like volatility, and things like volatility, and it's a very, very extremely bipolar view of the world. You almost have nothing in between.
> 
> Effectively, all I did is generalize this idea, to map it to things that option traders-- because option traders, all they do is they drink and they trade options, so they don't have exposure outside of that narrow field. So all I'm doing is representing them to take the idea outside.
> 
> And we can do a lot of things, because effectively, fragility is something I can measure and anti-fragility is something I can measure.
> 
>But risk, you can't really measure--unless, of course, you're at Harvard or Stanford or one of these places where they have the illusion where they can measure risk. But in reality, we can't measure risk. It's something in the future. I can measure fragility.\
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/7bD82A0.png)\
> The graph you have here shows you very simply a fragile payoff where nothing happens most of the time. When something happens, it's negative. You see? This is a fragile, and everything fragile has this property.
> 
> To give you a hint, we can generalize it to medicine where you take pills that give you very small benefits. The benefits are small or nonexistent, and the harm is large and rare and often not seen in the past history of the product. That's a fragile.
> 
> I take a pill, it gives me small benefits, and then 10 years later, you realize that it gave you cancer or some hidden disease that nobody saw. It's the same payoff for fragile.\
>![](https://i.imgur.com/TRMK4AA.png)
> The robust will have this payoff--it doesn't care--and the anti-fragile will have this payoff where harm is small and the big variations are positive, are favorable.
So this is sort of like the idea or the general idea.

#### Examples of Antifragile

> “So we tend to over-technologize and underestimate the might of the equivalent of these small wheels on suitcases that will be staring at us for the next millennia.”

## Johan Galtung
**7. [Conflict management and peacebuilding in everyday life](https://www.reddbarna.no/Media/dokumenter/ResourceKit-web.pdf)**

> We recognise that there are some similarities and overlaps between the concepts of conflict and violence as both conflict and violence can cause damage and harm. However, there are also some important differences. One of the most important differences is that while VIOLENCE is always negative and harmful, CONFLICT can sometimes be positive, if we respond to it in a constructive way.
> 
> Here is an example of positive outcomes associated with conflict described by children and young people in Asia: Through conflicts we can sometimes learn from our mistakes... conflict can encourage new thinking patterns and positive change.... the conflict response can lead to more justice.

**8. Galtung, [Conflict transformation by peaceful means](https://www.transcend.org/pctrcluj2004/TRANSCEND_manual.pdf)**

#### Collecting information from world religions ( Galtung’s Transcend Method )

- *following Hindu thought*, remember: Conflict the Destroyer and Conflict the Creator; conflict as a source of violence and conflict as a source of development. The conflict worker has the third role as Preserver, transforming the conflict by avoiding violence, promoting development.
- *following Buddhist thought*, remember: Codependent origination, everything grows together in mutual causation. Conflicts have no beginning and no end, we all share the responsibility; no single actor (like statesmen) carries all the responsibility (monopoly) and no single actor carries all the guilt.
- *following Christian thought*, remember: Ultimately, the responsibility for conflict transformation lies with individuals and their individual responsibility and decisions to act so as to promote peace rather than violence, and the principle of hope.
- *following Daoist thought*, remember: Everything is yin and yang, good and bad, there is the high likelihood that the action chosen also has negative consequences and that action not chosen may have positive consequences; hence the need for reversibility, only doing what can be undone.
- *following Islamic thought*, remember: The strength deriving from submitting together to a common goal, including the concrete responsibility for the wellbeing of all.
- *following Judaic thought*, remember: The truth lies less in a verbal formula than in the dialogue to arrive at the formula, and that dialogue has no beginning and no end.

#### Conflict management as a political philosophy

* **Conflict itself is not bad**. It is an expression of the diversity of interests, ideas and points of view. It arises in all human relationships and, like crises, can be excellent opportunities to grow, emerge stronger, learn and improve.
* When assuming conflicts are negative, people and institutions tend to fear them and adopt one of these two attitudes: 
  1) they resort to force, power or violence to crush them; or
  2) they ignore them hoping they will pass without addressing them.
* When a conflict arises, both parties may believe they have the only logical stance, since each sees the situation exclusively from their particular point of view. Hence the need and importance of dialogue, as a mechanism that allows the search for collectively constructed solutions through listening and incorporating the other’s perspective.
* **The quality of an institution is not determined by whether or not it has conflicts, but by how it manages to address them**.

* [PeacePower: Johan Galtung's Transcend Approach: Confederation in Iraq and a Middle East Community for Israel/Palestine](http://calpeacepower.org/0201/galtung_transcend.htm)
  > Transcend believes that all conflicts are born equal and have the same right to transformation; no conflict is "higher level" than another. Whether the solution lies in a shared national park or the creation of a community of six states, this philosophy ensures that each conflict is addressed by Transcend in the same, principled, peaceful and creative way. Galtung's visions for the peaceful solution of these current violent Middle Eastern conflicts represent peaceful, realistic and therefore compelling alternatives.

## John Burton - Conflict Resolution

**10. [Burton, Conflict resolution: Towards problem solving](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/51092982.pdf)** 

> Societies remain power-elite dominated. The diversion of resources to provide education and other services on an equitable basis is being increasingly resisted. Funds are being cut. There is a retreat to specialization, and a holistic approach to problems is politically unpopular. But if civilizations are to survive the contemporary trend towards increased crime and violence at all social levels has to be dealt with by means which eliminate it, rather than merely contain it within less privileged regions. Civilizations must, if they are to survive, move from power-elite politics to problem-solving. It is the responsibilities of universities in particular to bring these issues to attention, and to give students in all disciplines the opportunity to question, to explore and to innovate. This new a-disciplinary study, Conflict Resolution, provides an opportunity

 > Metamodernism seeks to collapse distances, especially the distance between things that seem to be opposites, to recreate a sense of wholeness that allows us to — in the lay sense — transcend our environment and move forward with the aim of creating positive change in our communities and the world. 
* [What Is Metamodernism?](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-is-metamodernism_b_586e7075e4b0a5e600a788cd)
 > Sometimes the sort of understanding metamodernism offers us is a logical understanding of how and why things happen during this particular period in human history. In this sense, we can see metamodernism as a  “system of logic” that helps us better navigate the digital age. 
 > 
 > At other times, metamodernism helps us understand our emotional reactions to things that are happening now—both our reaction as individuals, and the reactions of whole communities and even nations—at which point we can see metamodernism as a “structure of feeling.” 
 >
 > In short, cultural philosophies help us make sense of our times by seeing patterns in how entire cultures (and individual subcultures within those cultures) operate. And because American culture, like any culture, has political and economic subcultures as well as ones in which new art is regularly being made, metamodernism gives us a lens through which to consider nearly everything that’s happened in America [and the rest of the world] since the invention of the internet: political, socioeconomic, and sociocultural.

> “There are three different parts of political metamodernism:
> * **The Listening Society** — which is the welfare of the future, a welfare that includes the emotional needs and supports the psychological growth of all citizens. A society in which everyone is seen and heard (rather than manipulated and subjected to surveillance, which are the degenerate siblings of being seen and heard).
> * **Co-Development** — which is a kind of political thinking that works across parties, works to keep ego-issues and emotional investments and biased opinions in check, and seeks to improve the general climate of political discourse: “I develop if you develop. Even if we don’t agree, we come closer to the truth if we create better dialogues and raise the standards for how we treat one another.”
> * **The Nordic Ideology** — this is my name for the political structure that would support the long-term creation of the listening society and make room for co-development. It is called the Nordic ideology because its early sprouts are cropping up in and around Scandinavia. It includes a vision of six new forms of politics, all of which work together to profoundly recreate society. A large part of this has to do with how to defend citizens from new sources of oppression that can emerge as a side-effect of a “deeper” society. These new forms of oppression are generally of a more subtle and more psychological kind than what we have seen in the 20th century.”
